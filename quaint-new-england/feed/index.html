					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m originally from Massachusetts, but I&#039;ve only been to the Nubblie Lighthouse out of all of these. I love Maine, and well, New England in general. Have you ever been to Block Island? It&#039;s tiny compared to Martha&#039;s Vineyard, but I adore it. It&#039;s one of my favorite places ever. My husband and I spent some of our honeymoon there!]]></description>
