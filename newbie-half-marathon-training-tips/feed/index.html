					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more with these tips! I&#039;ve done two half-marathons and a full-marathon, and I think the right shoes are absolutely the key to feeling good during a run. I also love to make playlists and insert songs that get me pumped up around the time I need a pick-me-up. For example, I put &quot;Living on a Prayer&quot; at about the one-hour mark for my half marathon so I&#039;d know I was halfway there and to keep praying my way through. I know it&#039;s cheesy, but it helps in those tough moments!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah I&#039;m super nervous for race day but hopefully the adrenaline rush of the race helps me out! I remember when you did your half in September, I was so impressed because you said you didn&#039;t train for very long. I&#039;m afraid if I don&#039;t train I&#039;ll keel over on the side of the road during the race...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah I definitely feel like I need to stop myself from worrying so much about the time right now and just get my mileage in! I&#039;m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hal Higdon&#039;s half marathon training program&lt;/a&gt;, and for me it&#039;s been great so far! Thanks for the advice, Becky!]]></description>
