					<description><![CDATA[This is a wonderful post. As someone who didn&#039;t know what they wanted to do the entire time I went through undergrad, grad school, and even now most days I appreciate the honesty. I also have these conversations with my brothers who are now sophomores in college. Will definitely have to share that it&#039;s not just me who feels this way ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh I love this. When I was in school I definitely thought I would end up being a PR person somewhere or a creative at an ad agency. Which, obviously could still happen, but I love being in marketing for now! It&#039;s not what I majored in but it&#039;s close enough. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this post! I agree--you need to be able to learn and soak up information rather than just check off a bunch of required courses to get you that particular job. 
Jobs want to know that you can apply yourself, and yes, some you can only get from very specific programs, but the majority of the time if you&#039;re creative you can make it work! 
love the post!
