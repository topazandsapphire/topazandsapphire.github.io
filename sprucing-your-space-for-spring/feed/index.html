					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s so hard to be patient when you move into a new place, but also totally exciting as a new decorating evolution begins ;) Have you ever thought of buying a pretty basket you could fold/stuff your throws in, even if they&#039;re not super &quot;pretty&quot; a basket is functional while still being aesthetic and you wouldn&#039;t have to buy new throws! Happy spring to you too Hollie!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am just a pillow hoarder! So I pull out ones that are more &quot;fitting&quot; for the season. You could also always just go on Etsy and buy pillow covers, which is cheaper and an easy way to get a new &quot;look&quot; but I do love rearranging what I already have too. It&#039;s like a fun game haha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seasonal decorating isn&#039;t huge here in our household but I do love to spruce things up and keep it fresh.

We&#039;ve been in our new place for just over 10 weeks now and I am going crazy that I haven&#039;t had the opportunity to go and check out the local florist yet. One thing that always makes me happy is a beautiful bunch of blooms on the kitchen table. I&#039;m thinking that I might keep some in our living room too.

It&#039;s gradually getting colder here in Australia (though today is oddly warm at 28C) so we&#039;ve been dragging out the blankets and throws. I wouldn&#039;t mind getting some new ones though that are a little more &#039;pretty&#039; so I don&#039;t feel bad if they&#039;re in a heap/draped over the couch.

I hope your spring is a beautiful one, Latisha!]]></description>
