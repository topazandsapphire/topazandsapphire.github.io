								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As cliche as it might sound, my sister’s Topaz birthstone is as warm and sunny as she is.</p>
<p>She brightened my life the moment she entered the world with her head full of dark hair and her gummy smile. My parents warned me that Cassie wouldn’t be able to play or run around for awhile, but I was content to just have my arm around her carseat as she kept me company during my morning cartoons.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MG_7379-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-726" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MG_7379-copy-1024x683.jpg" alt="_MG_7379 copy" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MG_7379-copy-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MG_7379-copy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MG_7379-copy.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>Soon enough we were playing pretend and dress-up and getting into all kinds of adventures. And as we grew up, we only grew closer. She was there for every milestone and every heartbreak. (She can still rattle off the names of all my crushes from elementary school through high school &#8211; much to my utter dismay). I vividly remember her pig collection, the time she got stitches in her chin, and the moment she danced with our dad at her wedding. The memories are numerous.</p>
<p>Some of the best times I’ve had with my sister have been lying in bed side-by-side talking and laughing until the wee hours of the morning. Watching her, a beautiful dancer, take the stage. Driving in the car and singing Nick Lachey’s “What’s Left of Me” at the top of our lungs, even though we have no recollection of how the mediocre pop ballad became our song.</p>
<p>Though her elder sister, I am constantly learning from her and am amazed by her positivity and zest for life, the way she sets actionable goals, her ability to hold a friendly conversation with almost anyone she meets, and the way that only she can make me feel heroic in times of strife.</p>
<p>Growing up with Cassie was a blessing and getting older with her is a privilege. It’s been an honor these past 24 years to be her big sister, her best friend, and her forever confidant.</p>
<p>Happy birthday baby girl! I love you infinitely.</p>
