					<description><![CDATA[The first picture is not Queen&#039;s Bath.  It&#039;s close by, but that&#039;s not it.  Queen&#039;s Bath in the summer is fine, just avoid during the winter swells.  Glad you enjoyed the island!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I cannot believe that you promoted Queen&#039;s Bath. Locals will tell you: It&#039;s a spectacular place to die, as in, it&#039;s incredibly dangerous to swim there. 

On the way to Queen&#039;s Bath, you walked past a warning sign counting the number if people who have died after being washed out to sea from rogue waves, or being slammed against razor-sharp lava rock by powerful tides. 

Queen&#039;s Bath might look exciting, but you are being completely irresponsible for recommending it to your readers. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow Cassie, these are seriously gorgeous shots! The Queens Bath and Secret Beach look amazing, like I would go just for those two things, never mind all the biking and look out points and general amazing things.

love it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went late May 2015! It was a great time to go, not peak season yet so we felt more like locals rather than tourists. And I hear June is a great time to go for snorkeling! I hope you get to go for your honeymoon, it&#039;s a dream!]]></description>
