								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>With so much content circulating on Pinterest it can be pretty overwhelming to decipher what things to re-pin, like, or attempt to make. Let&#8217;s be honest, we&#8217;ve all had our fair share of Pinterest fails. It can be a complete letdown and a waste of time and money when you make a recipe you&#8217;ve pinned off Pinterest and it&#8217;s not even good!</em></p>
<p><em>To save your sanity and your tastebuds, we&#8217;ve curated some of the best recipes we&#8217;ve made and taste-tasted from Pinterest. So re-pin, strap on that apron, and eat up! Make sure to follow <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/topaznsapphire/" target="_blank">Topaz &amp; Sapphire</a> on Pinterest for more food, decor, and lifestyle inspiration.</em></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/332562753707890391/" target="_blank">Pumpkin Donuts</a></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-572" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pumpkin-Donuts-1024x768.jpg" alt="Pumpkin Donuts by Topaz and Sapphire" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pumpkin-Donuts.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pumpkin-Donuts-300x225.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pumpkin-Donuts-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Cassie made these the pumpkin donuts last year to celebrate the crisp autumn air and to welcome in one of her favorite holidays, Halloween. Let&#8217;s just say these donuts are rich, filling, and beyond satisfying and are too good to make during just one season. These pumpkin donuts are often being baked on Saturday mornings in the Dowling home, and their neighbors love it when they share.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/332562753707542316/" target="_blank">French Dip</a></h2>
<p>Crockpot recipes are the best &#8211; they&#8217;re quick, easy, and you can never really mess one up. This French Dip coupled with havarti cheese atop a toasted baguette will have your dinner guests yearning for seconds.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/332562753704613584/" target="_blank">Caprese Bread</a></h2>
<p>I never know what to bring as appetizers to dinner parties. This bread takes your average starter to extraordinary. Although considered an appetizer or side dish, don&#8217;t underestimate how filling this Italian caprese bread is.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/332562753707542347/" target="_blank">Peach &amp; Blackberry Cobbler</a></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-573" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_6299-768x1024.jpg" alt="Peach Blackberry Crisp" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_6299-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_6299-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Ever wonder what to do with a whole basket of gorgeous, ripe peaches from the farmer&#8217;s market? Thanks to our mama, we&#8217;ve discovered the perfect peach cobbler/crisp. Who knew the secret ingredient to the best peach cobbler would be blackberries? TO DIE FOR I&#8217;m telling you. Hurry and make this before peach season is over.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/388365167841523637/" target="_blank">Best Burger Ever</a></h2>
<p>This may not look or sound that amazing. But it is. It&#8217;s the best burger I&#8217;ve ever made hands-down. Even preferable to restaurant burgers. Since Latisha doesn&#8217;t eat red meat (much to Cassie&#8217;s horror and dismay) she uses ground turkey and it&#8217;s just as good. The key is the &#8220;secret sauce.&#8221; If you&#8217;re looking for a super quick and delicious recipe that is sure to satisfy your hunger craving, this is it.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/388365167841225442/" target="_blank">Crockpot BBQ Chicken</a></h2>
<p>This is another easy-peasy crockpot recipe. Great atop a salad or eaten in a sandwich.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/388365167841055930/" target="_blank">Chicken Pot Pie</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5804.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-578" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5804-1024x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_5804" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5804-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5804-150x150.jpg 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5804-300x300.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5804-80x80.jpg 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5804-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>This is YUM and the definition of comfort food. What&#8217;s super easy about it, is that it&#8217;s puff pastry (found in the refrigerated section of the grocery store) latticed over the top and you don&#8217;t have to worry about the hassle of making a pie crust. It&#8217;s more of a casserole take on chicken pot pie. I add more veggies than is recommended in the recipe because I think it makes it more hearty.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/388365167840669843/" target="_blank">Oven Fajitas</a></h2>
<p>This is another fast dinner recipe that is budget-friendly. Pump up the Ricky Martin, add some cheese, sour cream, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime atop a tortilla and you&#8217;re ready to go.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/388365167840504032/" target="_blank">Spicy Shrimp &amp; Zucchini Lo Mein</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5592.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-577" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5592-1024x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_5592" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5592-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5592-150x150.jpg 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5592-300x300.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5592-80x80.jpg 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_5592-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>Our grandmother is Thai, so this recipe goes without saying that it&#8217;s not super legit &#8220;Asian lo-mein.&#8221; We know what legit Thai noodles are supposed to taste like. However, I think that this recipe is pretty quick and easy when you want an Asian noodle fix. I use chicken instead of shrimp, just because shrimp tends to be more expensive and I don&#8217;t have a ton of experience cooking seafood. I also add lots more Siracha than the recipe calls for because I like it hot.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/388365167837871527/" target="_blank">Roasted Herb Veggies</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4874.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-576" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4874-1024x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_4874" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4874-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4874-150x150.jpg 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4874-300x300.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4874-80x80.jpg 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4874-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>It can be challenging to find ways to enjoy what I like to call &#8220;straight up vegetables.&#8221; Straight Up Vegetables are ones that aren&#8217;t in a salad covered in dressing or cheese, or deep fried. This recipe calls for herbs, spices, lemon juice and olive oil. That&#8217;s it. Then they&#8217;re oven roasted and perfectly edible, even delicious. Tip: the chopped onion is important as it adds flavor to the rest of the veggies, you don&#8217;t have to eat the onions if you don&#8217;t like them.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/388365167838079189/" target="_blank">Corn &amp; Cheese Chowder</a></h2>
<p>Last but not least is this recipe from the Pioneer Woman. (That alone should let you know that this recipe is tried and true). I like to add some shredded chicken to make the soup a heartier meal and eat it with some great buttered bread. Definitely not low on calories, but it&#8217;s one of those meals where that doesn&#8217;t matter because it&#8217;s so dang delicious.</p>
