								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I chose to major in business marketing because it was practical and versatile. I thoroughly enjoyed the curriculum in the business school while attending BYU. However, I always wondered how my career would be today if I majored in French, or graphic design, or psychology, or if I decided not to go to college at all. All of these things are interesting to me and I want to learn about them all, but I chose business because that meant the biggest job security.</p>
<p>My formal education is extremely valuable to me however, just because I choose to obtain a degree in marketing that doesn’t necessarily mean I am solely limited to a marketing career path.</p>
<p><img class="  wp-image-294 alignleft" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/floral-quote.jpeg" alt="floral quote" width="378" height="610" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/floral-quote.jpeg 550w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/floral-quote-186x300.jpeg 186w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" />I love marketing, I love working with people. I love the community created by marketing. However, my lifelong dream isn’t to work at a marketing agency. In all actuality I’m not even sure what my lifelong dream looks like. I do know though that my career progression does not have to be linear within marketing.</p>
<p>I’m allowed to learn and develop skills in other areas. In fact, I want to create. I want to discover. I want to travel and learn about different cultures. I want to build my own brand. I don’t want to work for someone else my entire life.</p>
<p>My point is, don’t let your college major deter you from doing things that you love. Don’t think your career needs to follow a certain process. Determine what success looks like to you, not to someone else. Dig deeper, self discover, and find out what truly makes you happy.</p>
<p>For you college kids trying to figure out what to major in, don’t stress so much about it. You’re main goal in college shouldn’t be to create a blueprint for your entire life’s journey, but rather it should be to learn how to learn. Remember that your college major isn’t your resume. Your resume is a set of skills (1). You will develop skills your entire life, not just in college or jobs related to your major.</p>
<p>With technology, the internet, and the countless resources readily available at our fingertips, the possibilities and opportunities to learn new skills are endless. Don’t let your college major stifle your progress from doing what you want to do. Let your education fuel you to learn more and to do more. Make your work life fit your life life (1). It’s simple &#8211; when you align your passions with your work, your work won’t feel like work.</p>
