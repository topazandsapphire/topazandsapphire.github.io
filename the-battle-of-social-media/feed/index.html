					<description><![CDATA[All the `gurus` say to post so much and I am new to all of this but just as a reader I think a whole bunch of posts all day is spammy. I also think- if you LOVE posting and you want to do it all day great, but for those of us who don&#039;t, why feel the pressure. plus thats what regramming is for right? Awesome post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree. I always feel like I need to post more, but I&#039;ve felt quality over quantity is better. Plus, I&#039;m able to enjoy things in the moment more in real life. It&#039;s a win-win!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read a lot about this story, and I love your perspective! We seriously need to stop worrying so much about what other people think about our social media feeds, and we DEFINITELY need to stop posting so often! I don&#039;t post on Instagram often (1-2 times per week). Sometimes I tell myself I need to be posting more, but honestly I think posting less regularly is better for me, mentally!]]></description>
