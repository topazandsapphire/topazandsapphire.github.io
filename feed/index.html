								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we&#8217;re rounding up some of our favorite home office spaces in hopes to inspire you to spice up your at-work or at-home office space.</p>
<p>If you work from home, it is so important that you have an area carved out that sparks creativity, productivity, and efficiency. While I love to lounge and get things done from the comfort of my couch, I can oftentimes get distracted by household chores, Netflix, or other people that are in my working area. This is why its vital to have a space, even if it&#8217;s just a little nook, dedicated to getting your work done and not being distracted when you take conference calls remotely.</p>
<h2>Below are 10 spaces that have inspired us to invest more into our home offices, or office nooks:</h2>

<p>As you can see from the above pictures it doesn&#8217;t take much to create a desirable home office space. Your space does not have to be big to be functional. Invest in a good desk, chair, and a few storage options and find a few things to make the space personal to you &#8211; like plants, pictures, or pillows!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each new year offers the opportunity to become a better you &#8211; to reset and reevaluate goals. As we begin 2019, I&#8217;ve decided to share my 2019 mantras with all of you. By sharing my goals I hope to inspire you to set some of your own, so we can work together to be the women we&#8217;re proudest to be.</p>
<p>As in years past, I have chosen to stick to two <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/a-new-year-a-new-motto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">words to live by</a>: &#8220;consistency&#8221; and &#8220;unstoppable.&#8221; These words will dictate the overarching theme of my specific goals this year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1500" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Through <strong>consistency </strong>I hope to build better and sustainable habits, while <strong>unstoppable </strong>encompasses all the bucket list items I wish to cross off this year. My only rule for creating my bucket list is that it can&#8217;t include anything I&#8217;ve already planned or booked already. (For example, if you signed up to run a half marathon in 2018 that takes place in 2019, you shouldn&#8217;t write &#8220;run a half marathon&#8221; on your list.)</p>
<p>Below are few examples of sub-goals and bucket list items I have made under each mantra. For me, making goals specific helps me to better follow through.</p>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Less sugar. Think of desserts as a treat or something special, versus an everyday snack I&#8217;m entitled to</li>
<li>Build a better nightly routine</li>
<li>Less mobile media consumption &#8211; i.e. 40 minutes of Instagram per day</li>
<li>Journal more (at least 2x per month)</li>
<li>Go to bed each night with a clean kitchen</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unstoppable</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visit 12 new cities or unfamiliar places</li>
<li>Read 20 books</li>
<li>Visit 1 new country</li>
<li>Complete 1 photo project</li>
<li>Join some sort of hobby-related club</li>
<li>Send 2 snail mail letters per month</li>
</ul>
<p>While this isn&#8217;t an all encompassing list, hopefully some of these things can help you spark ideas for goals or bucket list items  your own. It&#8217;s understood that not all individuals are the same and do not set or establish goals the same way. For me, writing down a list of things holds me accountable. Rather than living by a mantra, you may prefer creating a bucket list or creating monthly goals vs. yearly goals.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1502" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>However setting goals looks for you &#8211; embrace it! There is no right or wrong way to set goals. My only tip for setting New Year&#8217;s resolutions is to tell at least one other person your goals, whether that&#8217;s your mom, roomie, significant other, dog, etc. Telling someone else helps you feel more committed to your goals and gives you a greater sense of accountability in order to accomplish them. And remember, it&#8217;s never too late to set goals!</p>
<h2>The Importance of Setting Goals</h2>
<p>Setting goals has always been so important to me. With an <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achiever personality</a>, a lot of my self-satisfaction comes from achieving something, even if it&#8217;s small. Even without this type of personality, I find almost <em>all</em> people, whether they know it or not, feel their best when they have accomplished something they have worked toward. Whether that&#8217;s sleep training your baby, getting that promotion at work, or learning to bake a fluffy chocolate chip cookie &#8211; anytime you&#8217;re accomplishing something as an individual are moments you can look back on with fondness. Some of our proudest moments in life are when we&#8217;ve successfully completed something we&#8217;ve set our minds to accomplish or improve in ourselves, which is why it&#8217;s so important to set goals &#8211; big and small!</p>

<h3>A Special Shout Out to Our Readers</h3>

We want this blog to serve as an inspirational and educational platform, and we can&#8217;t do that without all of you &#8211; so thank you to all of you as readers and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/topazandsapphire/">followers</a>.</p>

While I am by no means a fashionista, I do enjoy shopping (what woman doesn't love a little retail therapy) and expressing myself through the clothes that I wear.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though a self-proclaimed summer girl, I have to say there&#8217;s something so magical about the fall. The glow of the trees as the leaves change from green to yellow and orange to red, the crisp mornings, and the fog that hovers over the Puget Sound horizon are all some of my favorite things about autumn in Washington. No matter where I am living though, my love for fall fashion remains the same! While I am by no means a fashionista, I do enjoy shopping (what woman doesn&#8217;t love a little retail therapy) and expressing myself through the clothes that I wear. I love that fall fashion allows you to mix textures, prints, and layers without having to worry about bundling up for freezing temperatures, or losing layers for hot muggy summers.</p>
<p>This season I&#8217;m <em>falling </em>for cheetah print. I&#8217;ve always been a leopard print fan, but I&#8217;m loving all of the new ways I&#8217;m seeing it styled and used in different wardrobe pieces. Cheetah has definitely progressed from being a statement piece to more of a neutral in my eyes. So, for all of my cheetah sisters out there, I&#8217;ve rounded up all of my favorite cheetah print autumn wardrobe staples, all under $150!<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My least favorite thing is when I&#8217;m looking for a recipe in a blog post and I have to scroll down and down and down until I can finally get the recipe at the bottom of a very lengthy blog post. So this will be short and sweet so you can get what you came for &#8211; DONUTS<span id="more-1451"></span> (well, the recipe)!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1454" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Attachment-1-768x1024.jpeg" alt="topaz and sapphire homemade pumpkin donuts" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Attachment-1-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Attachment-1-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>I discovered this recipe on Pinterest nearly five autumns ago and it&#8217;s been <a href="https://bromabakery.com/2011/10/homemade-pumpkin-donuts.html">my go to pumpkin donut recipe</a> ever since. I love how it has become somewhat of a fall tradition in our home to make a dozen or so of these every autumn and to share with our neighbors, friends, or family members that are living close to us at that time.</p>
<p>I love that small traditions like baking pumpkin donuts on a lazy fall Sunday morning can bring so much warmth, happiness, and excitement (mostly from my salivating husband and pup) into your home. Happy baking, and happy fall!</p>
<p>The only thing I ask of you now that I&#8217;ve shared this homemade pumpkin donut recipe with you is to keep sharing it, and to share a donut or two of your batch with a stranger, or acquaintance. This recipe is a great excuse to make a best friend in an instant (yes, they&#8217;re that good people!), and to share a little bit of happiness to someone outside of your normal social circle.</p>
<h2>Homemade Pumpkin Spice Donuts</h2>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<p><em>For the donuts:</em></p>
<p>3 1/2 cups all purpose flour<br />
4 teaspoons baking powder<br />
1 teaspoon salt<br />
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice<br />
1 cup sugar<br />
2 tablespoons butter<br />
2 eggs<br />
2 teaspoons vanilla<br />
1/2 cup buttermilk<br />
1 cup pumpkin puree<br />
Canola or vegetable oil for frying</p>
<p><em>For the buttermilk glaze:</em></p>
<p>3 cups powdered sugar<br />
1/2 cup buttermilk<br />
1/2 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1456" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Attachment-2-768x1024.jpeg" alt="topaz and sapphire pumpkin donut recipe" width="300" height="400" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Attachment-2-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Attachment-2-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-1455" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg" alt="easy baking recipes" width="300" height="400" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Attachment-3-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
<p>In a large bowl or Kitchen Aid mixer, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, spice and sugar. Then, whisk together all of the wet ingredients (butter, eggs, vanilla, buttermilk, pumpkin puree) in a second, medium bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir them around the bowl until the mixture is well combined. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface, rolling the donut dough to approximately 1/4-1/2″ thick. Cut with a donut cutter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whisk the glaze ingredients together in a small bowl until smooth.</p>
<p>Heat 2 inches of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, gently slide the donuts into the oil, frying on the first side until the edges of the donut are lightly browned, flip carefully and allow to cook on the other side until lightly browned. Remove and dunk immediately into buttermilk glaze. Allow to air dry on a cooling rack before serving.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pike’s Place Market is a Seattle staple for both tourists and locals alike. Whenever we have people come from out of town to visit this is probably our first stop. We eat our way through Pike’s Place one croissant or yogurt at a time whilst admiring the freshly cut flowers, grown from a farm nearby. For those who are planning a trip to Seattle, here are my recommended pit stops that will have you visiting Pike’s Place like you’re a local!</span><span id="more-1419"></span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tip: Bring cash! They only accept cash so be prepared to dish out those bills. A dozen mini donuts only cost about $6.50, so you don’t need much. </span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tip: When ordering the Mac &amp; Cheese opt for an 8 oz if you’re eating it alone, it’s pretty rich, plus there are a lot more food stops in Pike&#8217;s that you must make room for in your stomach.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tip: Come at night and enjoy an intimate burlesque show. There is no signage for the Pink Door restaurant as it literally is just a pink door down the Post Alley. Don’t worry once you open the door, you’ll soon realize it’s not a secret backdoor to someone’s home, but an entrance to a nice restaurant.</span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t bring your big dogs. Dogs are not allowed in the covered market areas. If you choose to bring your big dog you’ll be missing out on seeing the famous fish tossing, gorgeous seasonal flower vendors, and the Daily Dozen Donuts. Not to mention, the market is chock full of both tourists and locals so your dog will likely be overwhelmed with the crowds and many scents the market has to offer. We have a small dog and bring her occasionally with us to the market only because in the covered areas we can hold her! </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Always bring cash. Most food vendors accept both card and cash, however you’ll want to bring a few extra dollars to tip the street performers, singers, and pianists. It’s definitely not an obligation, but you’ll make someone’s day a bit brighter if you do. Some flower vendors also give you a discount if you use cash, so keep that in mind too!</span></li>
<li>The fruit at Pike&#8217;s Place is a-mazing, however, it is a bit pricier too. Take advantage of those free samplers!</li>
<li>The famous gum wall is down the stairs to the left of the flying fish (underneath the big Pike Place Market sign). Don&#8217;t forget a pack of gum to help contribute, that is if you&#8217;re not too grossed out by an alleyway full of chewed up gum.</li>
<li>The first Starbucks is indeed in Pike&#8217;s Place. Do yourself a favor and take a picture of it, but skip the huge line and go the the Starbucks&#8217; that are literally one block on each side of Pike&#8217;s Place Market if you need your morning dose of coffee.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the start of this year, I’ve focused less on resolutions and more on resolving to do and be better in general. Goals are great, but <b>habits are what bring about real change</b>. After all, goals are successfully attained as the result of habituated actions that help you reach them. I decided to focus more on changing certain habits and less on measurable goals, to see what happened. The result? An overall happier me. Here are six simple changes I made to my mentality, my routine, or my daily habits that have truly changed me for the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Going to bed at a set time &amp; waking up with positive intentions</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1400" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-300x300.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-768x768.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-80x80.jpg 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>I am a natural night-owl, which usually makes for rough mornings. It’s especially hard for me to turn in at a decent hour on days where I feel like my whole day has been comprised of work and errands. I’d rather stay up to get in some much-needed “me” time. However, the gains don’t compensate for the losses I take the next day — in mood, energy level, or productivity. As an adult, it’s seems counterintuitive to give yourself a bedtime, but it’s worked wonders for me.</p>
<p>Going hand-in-hand with a decent bedtime, is getting up on the right side of the bed each morning. I do my best to wake up with positive intentions for the day, rather than grumble about work, the weather, wanting to sleep in, or any other negativity that may come all too easily when my soft sheets are begging me to stay. I say <i>intentions, </i>because life is not perfect and some days will go wrong, perkiness be damned. But after my dad had a very serious health scare last year, I realized that every day is not promised and I can control how I approach each morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Viewing exercise as a choice, not a chore</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1402" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="856" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender.jpg 749w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender-242x300.jpg 242w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></a></p>

<p>How many times have you caught yourself saying, “I have to work out” when talking about exercise? Do you <i>have </i>to? Will you be penalized if you don’t? It seems silly to say “I get to work out,” but after I fractured my ankle two summers ago and was casted for three months, I realized what a privilege it is to have a fully functioning body.</p>
<p>Up until then, I had mostly viewed exercise at the very least, as a chore, and at the worst — as a punishment. Whether it was because I had only clocked in a couple sessions that week or had eaten something unhealthy, exercise was my recompense. If you know me, this may come as a surprise since I’m an avid exerciser. What a way to live, huh?! It’s like finding out an artist feels forced to pick up a paintbrush.</p>
<p>Being injured helped me realize that exercise is a choice and it’s my responsibility to view this positive choice in the positive light that it deserves — as a way to take care of myself, as an appreciation of my miraculous working body, and as a pathway to endorphins. It’s helped me become more committed to my workouts, even on days when they may not conveniently fit into my schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Establishing social media boundaries</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1404" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-1024x806.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="535" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-1024x806.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-300x236.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-768x605.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>Social media is a tool that connects people all over the world. It helps businesses thrive, is a platform for people to make money, and provides inspiration in every category from interior design to the culinary arts.</p>
<p>But as everyone knows, there’s also a dark side to social media — comparison, online bullying, jealousy, and loss of productivity are just a few black holes of social media.</p>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit that I have found myself trapped in several of these black holes, whether it’s an absent-minded time suck or comparing my body to a model’s photoshopped perfection. In order to combat these pitfalls, I started to establish social media boundaries.</p>
<p>First, I unfollowed most bloggers, celebrities, and other people whose job it is to make their social media an effervescent highlight reel. The lives portrayed on social media by many who are getting paid to be influencers don’t depict all the realities of human life, and while there’s nothing wrong with this, it’s best for me to not subject myself to media masquerades on a daily basis. Second, I implemented “designated Instagram time” throughout my day. I try to stick to only checking my social media platforms at work in the morning, during my lunch break, and when I get home from work. It helps me be more in the moment, to not get distracted from work, and to still keep up with my Instagram fam in a way that feels healthy. Lastly, I periodically go on “fasts.” While the nature of my job makes it impossible to stay off of social media completely, I will spend a few weeks occasionally foregoing my personal accounts so that I can stay off the grid for awhile and just be me, without the hashtags.</p>
<p>What works for me may not be what works for you. Maybe you eat, live, sleep, and breathe social media without a problem or maybe you could care less about posting. The undeniable fact is that we live in a digital age inundated by Tweets, status updates, and photo sharing. I want to carve out my corner of the digital space, while also keeping my feet on solid (real world) ground, and this is how I accomplish that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Swapping the T.V. remote for a book</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1405" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-300x169.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>Growing up, I was the child under the covers with a flashlight reading into the night well past my bedtime. As a teenager, I never much minded summer reading for school and going to the library felt a little like Disney World. And then dial-up internet went obsolete and wifi happened. And then Netflix happened. And then Hulu happened. And then On Demand happened. And you know what? It became a lot less effort to watch anything I wanted at the tips of my fingers than to delve into a book.</p>
<p>Even though I once considered myself a bookworm, I had turned into a couch potato. It’s not to say that I didn’t read, because I did. But the amount of hours I spent bingeing a new series far outnumbered the amount of pages I was consuming — and it bothered me.</p>
<p>I told myself that I would read at least one book per month. Reading during my lunch hour and at least an hour before bed each night has helped me surpass this quota, and has also rekindled my love for the world that the written word opens up.</p>
<p>“The book is always better” because your imagination fills in all the holes a movie or T.V. show typically would for you. My imagination is my happy place and it’s fun to be a resident of it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Meal prepping every Sunday</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1406" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="767" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2.jpg 742w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2-266x300.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>

<p>If you ask me on a Sunday if I like meal prepping, the answer is, “Not really.” If you ask me Monday-Saturday if I like meal prepping, the answer is a resounding, “YAS!”</p>
<p>Meal prepping requires just that — preparation. Researching recipes, making a list of ingredients, and grocery shopping all have to happen before you even make the meal. All these things considered, meal prep takes up a valuable 4-5 hours of my weekend. But, I’m personally willing to sacrifice my Sunday evenings for a list of benefits that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spending quality time with my husband</li>
<li>Doing something that doesn’t involve a screen</li>
<li>Having healthy meals throughout the week</li>
<li>Saving money by not going out to eat for lunch during the work week</li>
<li>Not having to worry about “what’s for dinner” after a long day’s work</li>
</ul>
<p>Meal prepping essentially gives me time back during the work week when I need it most and clears my schedule for other things like workouts, down time, or time with friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Saying “yes” when it counts, and “no” when it matters</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1407" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png" alt="" width="651" height="972" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png 545w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></a></p>
<p>I think the most valuable things you can give someone are your time and your word. If somebody asks for a favor, I rarely say no. While an admirable trait, it’s something that has caused me to feel overwhelmed on many occasions. I don’t like disappointing people and I tend to put a lot on my plate even when I know I should be delegating responsibilities. Additionally, as an introvert, I also feel a lot of pressure to speak up in meetings, go to happy hour after work when I’d rather go home, or fear I’m “wasting” my Saturday night in PJs when I should be out having fun.</p>
<p>I’ve been learning to say “yes” when it counts and “no” when it matters.</p>
<p>What I mean by this is, you should agree to things if:</p>
<ol>
<li>Another person could benefit, without doing physical/emotional/mental harm to yourself</li>
<li>You benefit from it — whether personally, professionally, spiritually, intellectually, mentally, etc.</li>
<li>It will cause you to grow in some way</li>
<li>It makes you feel good</li>
</ol>
<p>You should reject things that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make you feel used, unappreciated, or highly uncomfortable</li>
<li>Cause you to feel emotional, physical, or mental distress</li>
<li>Hinder you or stall your growth</li>
<li>You don’t want to do (within reason)</li>
</ol>
<p>Skipping out on a social event for some alone time is okay. Skipping out on a phone conversation with your brother because you’d rather catch up on Game of Thrones, is not. Speaking up in a meeting, while uncomfortable, is something that you should practice — especially if you have something to contribute. Saying “no” to a toxic friendship doesn’t make you a bad person, and saying “yes” to everything doesn’t necessarily make you a good one.</p>
<p>These six simple changes don’t require a drastic amount of time, money, or effort, but rather decisiveness, discipline, and practice. Feel free to share in the comments changes that you’ve made in your life that have transformed you for the better.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We took a trip for 10 days to Thailand in honor of our dad’s upcoming 50th birthday. We made pit stops in Bangkok and Nakhon Phanom, my dad’s birth place, before heading for the southern coast of Thailand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Bangkok is bustling and Nakhon Phanom is idyllic and I loved both cities, Phuket has been at the top of my travel bucket list for the last few years. It&#8217;s been filling up my Pinterest feed for awhile, so by the time we landed in Phuket the building anticipation was definitely about to overflow. Luckily, Phuket did not disappoint. Here’s what I recommend doing if you’re planning a trip to Phuket soon.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Disclaimer: *Pictures do not do this place justice.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Disclaimer #2: Not all of Phuket (dirty streets, masses of people, crazy drivers) is depicted in the pictures below.</span></em></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">1. John Gray Sea Canoe Tour</span></h2>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1376" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5143-768x1024.jpg" alt="John Gray Sea Canoe Tour " width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5143-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5143-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1392" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/John-Gray-Sea-Canoe-Tour-1-of-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="Things to do in Phuket, Thailand" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/John-Gray-Sea-Canoe-Tour-1-of-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/John-Gray-Sea-Canoe-Tour-1-of-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1390" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_5193-768x1024.jpg" alt="Kratong Phuket" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_5193-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_5193-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A highlight of the trip! The tour starts at noon and goes until 9 PM. Expect a day full of delicious food, beautiful landscapes, and exotic day explorations of sea caves that were discovered by <a href="http://www.johngray-seacanoe.com/">John Gray</a> himself. You top the night off by floating your own self-made flower “kratong” in a spiritual, natural light show.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">2. Scuba Dive</span></h2>
<div id="attachment_1381" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1381" class="size-large wp-image-1381" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HB-Goodie-Image-Hawaii-683x1024.jpg" alt="Scuba Dive in Phuket Thailand" width="680" height="1020" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HB-Goodie-Image-Hawaii-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HB-Goodie-Image-Hawaii-200x300.jpg 200w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HB-Goodie-Image-Hawaii-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HB-Goodie-Image-Hawaii.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1381" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by: <a href="https://www.hbgoodie.com/">Heather Goodie</a></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something I SO badly wanted to do, but, unfortunately didn’t have time for. Snorkeling was amazing off of Krabi (another Thailand coastal province), so I can only imagine how fantastic the scuba diving would be. I would recommend booking your tour <a href="http://superdiversphuket.com/padi-courses-phuket/discover-scuba-diving-phuket/">with this company</a> &#8211; they were super responsive and have amazing reviews on Trip Advisor. If time allows for more than a “Discover Scuba” trip, get certified over the course of three days. Even Aussies, who have the Great Barrier Reef at their fingertips, rant and rave about the marine life in Thailand. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">3. Get a massage, or two. </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So cheap ($10 for an hour), so good, so relaxing. If you’re not into the typical Thai massage, opt for a facial or traditional oil massage. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297930-d4323900-Reviews-Puluang_1_Thai_Massage-Patong_Kathu_Phuket.html">Go here</a> if you’re staying in Patong, but beware of “special” massages at places you may come across randomly on the streets.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">4. Watch a Muy Thai fight. </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When in Thailand, do as the Thai people do! Recommended for anybody who&#8217;s into contact sports, boxing, and the adrenaline that comes from the rush of witnessing up-close combat.<br />
</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">5. Stock up on mango smoothies. </span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1379" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ACS_0025-768x1024.jpg" alt="Things to do Phuket Thailand" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ACS_0025-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ACS_0025-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sold on the street for $3 or less, this stuff is liquid gold. Don’t be afraid to barter down if you’re getting multiple, as Thai people are always willing to negotiate on a deal. #doublefisting</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">6. Phi Phi Island Hopping Tour</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1375" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5330-768x1024.jpg" alt="Phuket, Thailand" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5330-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5330-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>

<p>There are so many of these tours to choose from, I would recommend choosing a high speed boat tour so you have more time spent soaking up the turquoise blue waters and the white sandy beaches, and less time at sea getting from island to island. Not to mention, the high speed boat tours offer a complimentary buffet lunch on a private island, and free snacks/drinks all day. My favorite was Monkey Beach, Phi Phi, and snorkeling near a sand bar in the middle of the sea.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">7. Elephant Sanctuary </span></h2>
<div id="attachment_1394" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1394" class="size-large wp-image-1394" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-3.32.11-PM-1024x764.png" alt="" width="680" height="507" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-3.32.11-PM-1024x764.png 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-3.32.11-PM-300x224.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-3.32.11-PM-768x573.png 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-3.32.11-PM-320x240.png 320w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-3.32.11-PM.png 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1394" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/troyhuynhv2/">Troy</a></p></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.phuketelephantsanctuary.org/">Phuket Elephant Sanctuary</a> offers a refuge for retired, overworked, and injured elephants. It&#8217;s a place where you can observe, feed, and interact with elephants in a safe and humane setting.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Choose the morning session to avoid the afternoon heat.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">A few tips while planning your Phuket trip: </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We stayed in <a href="http://www.phuketgraceland.com/">a big resort</a> on Patong Beach. If I had to do it again I would definitely stay in a different part of Phuket, something more relaxed, and less “spring breaky.” The nightlife is popping, but as retired-from-the-nightlife married women, it wasn’t our scene, or our ideal oasis. Patong Beach is also pretty busy. Luckily for us, we could still catch some R&amp;R and some rays at one of the five private pools provided at our hotel.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1380" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ACS_0024-1024x768.jpg" alt="Sunset on Patong Beach | Phuket Thailand" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ACS_0024-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ACS_0024-300x225.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ACS_0024-768x576.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ACS_0024-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phuket is a big city, and the pictures you see above are mostly from the many islands off of the coast of Phuket. We were anticipating a remote location filled with bungalows and a few resorts. If you want to experience that, I’d suggest flying into Phuket and then island hopping from there. It’s much harder to do this though if traveling with a bigger group, so also keep this in mind if you’re planning something outside of a couple’s trip! </span></p>
<p>No matter where you go in Thailand, bring baby wipes. A lot of public restrooms in Thailand only have a &#8220;water sprayer&#8221; attached to the toilet to rinse off your bum after using the restroom, with no toilet paper in sight. This is when having your own baby wipes come in handy!</p>
<p>Always know the address and phone number of the place you are visiting. You can&#8217;t expect all taxi drivers to know where everything is and the language barrier can be tough, so just show them on your phone and you can rest assured you will get to Point B just fine.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to be hired by laylagrayce.com in their first year —  it was an incredible experience to work in an environment run by women who were excited and inspired by what they were doing.  It was (then) a small office where I wore many hats and learned a lot because I was fresh out of college and had a lot to prove! I caught a glimpse of the world of home furnishings and the inner-workings behind furniture production, manufacturing and delivering goods to the end-user. It was a crash course in problem solving, customer service and the ever-changing world of home fashion.</p>
<p><b>You decided you wanted to become an interior designer after you had already finished your Bachelor’s Degree in Public Relations. What made you decide to go back to school for Interior Design?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From a young girl, I always had a propensity for arranging things and improving the way things around me looked.  I can’t tell you how many times I repainted my childhood bedroom —  thanks Mom!  From landscapes to home interiors, fashion and even architecture, it was as if I were storing mental photographs and collecting my own pre-Pinterest idea board of my most favorite places, color combinations, concepts and ideas… and more importantly the way those things made me feel. There is a true connection between quality of life and what we choose to surround ourselves with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After working in e-commerce, wedding planning and corporate PR, I realized that if I was going to make a career out of my work, I wanted it to be something that made me jump out of bed in the morning. I went back to school to gain the knowledge and skill base to back up my passion for “beautifying”!  It gave me the confidence to stand behind what I already felt about the world of design.</span></p>

<p><b>Tell us a little bit about how you felt about working when you became pregnant with your first child, Blair. Did you anticipate going back to work full/part-time after you had her? Did that perspective change at all after having Blair, or after having your twins?</b></p>
<p>Blair’s birth was such an incredible blessing in my life!  Throughout the pregnancy I reminded myself that it was unfair to set expectations until I knew what life would be like with a new baby.  Maybe I would want to jump back into work, maybe I would be struck with the desire to stay home with her and hang up my tool belt. I was glad for this perspective and would say the same to any first-time mom. Don’t stress — know that change is the only certain thing and take it one day at a time.</p>
<p>It wasn’t without its growing pains, but after an extended maternity leave I began to work part-time and it was wonderful! I was able to keep my foot in the door of design and spend lots of quality time with my new baby. Most days I still think that I wasn’t cut out for “stay-at-home motherhood,” it is one TOUGH gig! Respect (to those who do it)! I am grateful to have the chance to pursue a career I love and set my own schedule, (but) family still comes first.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1349" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Stimpson-Oviatt-Kids.jpg" alt="Topaz &amp; Sapphire - Women Who Work" width="812" height="580" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Stimpson-Oviatt-Kids.jpg 812w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Stimpson-Oviatt-Kids-300x214.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Stimpson-Oviatt-Kids-768x549.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Stimpson-Oviatt-Kids-242x172.jpg 242w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></p>
<p>With the subsequent birth of my twins, I gave myself the same advice —  no unrealistic expectations, take it easy and do what feels right. Within a few months of their births, I felt the pull back to work and began to set my client schedule accordingly — starting slow and working my way back up to a work week that I could manage.</p>
<p><b>What drove you to continue your career after having your three kids?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling the support of family, peers and clients gave me the confidence to jump back into design. I get an incredible sense of satisfaction when my hard work, creativity and execution results in a transformed space and a happy client!  Like I said before, people are SO much happier in spaces that have elements of beauty, function and purpose — spaces that reflect the best version of who they are and how they want to live. To be able to deliver that service to my clients is the most incredible reward.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1346" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Topaz-Sapphire-805x1024.jpg" alt="Topaz &amp; Sapphire - Women Who Work" width="680" height="865" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Topaz-Sapphire-805x1024.jpg 805w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Topaz-Sapphire-236x300.jpg 236w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Topaz-Sapphire-768x978.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Topaz-Sapphire.jpg 1019w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><b>What excites you most about pursuing a career in interior design?</b></p>
<p>I recently heard a renowned designer say, “I believe that beauty will save the world, and I like to think I’m doing my part.” I LOVE that. I couldn’t agree more. Happy homes create happy people and that is a powerful thing! From a personal standpoint, it is gratifying to have a career where I can do what I love, continue to stretch myself and use my talents to improve the lives of others. There are so many facets of this career and I think it is a lifelong pursuit.</p>
<p><b>Where do you derive your creativity and/or inspiration?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I constantly study the world around me. It’s a blessing and a curse! For example, I can’t watch a romantic comedy without critiquing the set design. I’ve watched You’ve Got Mail and The Holiday at least a hundred times! I love to study the work of other designers and read about their methods and successes. I take EVERYTHING in… from the colors of the changing seasons to the color combinations used in fashion and floral design. I study spaces and images to develop a better sense of scale, proportion, balance and other design elements that truly make for incredible spaces. It is part science, part creativity and part serendipity!</span></p>

<p><b>Who are your favorite interior designers?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could never talk about the designers I love most without crediting Candice Olson and Sarah Richardson. As a teenager I watched them thrive as “TV designers” and I think it has given me the confidence to venture into television. I loved the glimpse into their projects, their everyday lives, their triumphs and trials of the job. Both Sarah and Candice have an on-camera presence that really made an impression on me.</span></p>
<p><b>You mentioned that you have ventured into television. How are you involved with Studio 5? How did you get involved with doing regular segments on Studio 5?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During my undergrad studies in communications, I took broadcast classes and felt really comfortable in front of the camera. Even though I didn&#8217;t have a passion for current events or news writing, my parents frequently reminded me of my talent in broadcast. A few years into my design career, I was looking for a way to combine my passion for design and a little TV work. I had a friend at the time who was an assistant producer for KSL Studio 5 — the Salt Lake City NBC affiliate — and she suggested I try a segment on their show. I submitted a list of about twenty topics I felt comfortable presenting and scripted the first one on the list. Ten years later and with almost 100 segments under my belt, I still continue to love the connections I make with a wide audience of like-minded, wonderful people and the thrill of being in front of the camera. The producers and staff working on the show believe in empowering women, strengthening families, and sharing tangible ways to live a better life.  As a regular design contributor, I am grateful and lucky to be a part of something so wonderful.</span></p>

<p><b>What does a day-in-the life look like for you?</b></p>
<p>I currently dedicate four days a week to work &#8211; each of those days starts with breakfast with the kiddos, school drop off for Blair, and a BIG hug and kiss goodbye to the twins.  I typically spend a few hours in the office making calls and sending e-mails, before spending the afternoon with clients, on job sites, sourcing materials or installing/accessorizing rooms. No two days are EVER the same! There is always a massive, running “to-do” list — any working mom knows what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My day off happens to be Friday — hooray for Friday!  I spend the day in sweats, with a ponytail, fully immersed in the world of my kids. I love it, I live for it!</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1342" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-Who-Work-Interior-Designer-1024x768.jpg" alt="Topaz &amp; Sapphire - Women Who Work" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-Who-Work-Interior-Designer-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-Who-Work-Interior-Designer-300x225.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-Who-Work-Interior-Designer-768x576.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-Who-Work-Interior-Designer-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><b>You work hand-in-hand with your mother-in-law on a regular basis. What has your experience been working for a family business? Would you recommend it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me working in a family business has been a blessing! I’ve had a boss who loves my kids like I do and who believes like I do that family comes first. My mother-in-law has been a tremendous mentor to me and has always given me the freedom and encouragement to manage my own jobs in my own way.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have gone against all odds when it comes to mother-in-law/daughter-in-law relationships, but after ten years, we are still a happy couple! </span></p>
<p><b>What’s your most memorable #GIRLBOSS moment to date?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think back ten years to the first deposit I received from a client remodeling her bedroom.  It wasn’t a million dollars, but it could have been! I had such a rush to have that check in my hand and feel the client’s trust and excitement for the vision I had presented to her. “She actually thinks I can do this! Maybe I CAN!!” </span></p>
<p><b>What’s been the best part of motherhood?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having a front row seat to the growth, development and exploration of three young minds.  Being a parent has taught me life lessons that I could have never learned otherwise. At the forefront? Patience, forgiveness, being unselfish, the importance of quality time and recognizing what truly matters, how we show love to one another!  Motherhood is a blessing beyond description — and it isn’t for the faint of heart!  It is the toughest job in the world. Any mom is a working mom! </span></p>
<p><b>How do you balance both motherhood and your career?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take life one step at a time. Sometimes the week is so hectic I take it one hour at a time! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I try to take things in stride, knowing that my plate will always be full but at least I can try to keep it organized and stay one step ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily, my clients have kids and families too and I’m grateful we have a similar understanding of project timing — around their summer vacation or other hectic seasons of life! I wouldn’t love what I do if I had horrible clients. I think I work for some of the best people I’ve ever met.  </span></p>
<p><b>Do you have any side hustles, passions, or interests that you’re involved in?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you follow my instagram you may have a seen a #weekendblooms post or two. I love dabbling in floral design!  I also love entertaining — well, correction, the “hosting” side of things, NOT the cooking side of things. It is all part of my quest to beautify what surrounds me… a pretty table setting, a vase full of flowers for the bedside table in my guest room, a simple gift for a friend tied with trim worth more than the gift itself! </span></p>

<p><b>What advice would you give to any woman aspiring to keep/grow their career as they enter motherhood?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can have everything you want, just not all at once.”  I have prioritized family and work…. so right now, other things are taking a backseat —  like bookclub, classes at the gym, and making gourmet meals every night. I’m okay with that!  Other suggestions to remember during moments of mom-stress or feeling less-than: don’t be so hard on yourself, we are ALL a work in progress, and be sure to take a minute to look around — blessings surround us all! Keep moving forward, do the best you can, (and) look in the mirror and be proud of what you see!</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">“Me too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s such a validating statement. Just two simple words and boom — instant kinship and an evocation of mutual understanding.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1328 size-full" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic.png" alt="metoographic" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic.png 800w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic-150x150.png 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic-300x300.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic-768x768.png 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic-80x80.png 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/metoographic-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you ever been to that sushi place on Main Street? I love that place!”</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too!”</span></i></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Christmas is definitely my favorite holiday.”</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too, it seriously is the most wonderful time of the year.”</span></i></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was sexually assaulted.”</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too.”</span></i></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That last couplet is an echo that has been sweeping the nation (and beyond) in the aftermath of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stories women have been coming forward with regarding media mogul Harvey Weinstein.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Actress Alyssa Milano’s “me too” response tweet soon went viral with thousands of women relaying their own personal stories of sexual assault. Some kept their revelations straightforward with a simple “#MeToo” and nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is nothing simple about this. The mass response of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just those who felt comfortable sharing their stories </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exemplifies the magnitude of the problem surrounding rape culture and sexual assault.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is not a Harvey Weinstein thing. This is not a Bill Cosby thing. This is not an aberrational thing.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">What this is, is an epidemic. </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a silent killer. It is embedded into the fabric of our society. It’s how women are portrayed in the media. It’s the fact that women still get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. It’s how a painful disclosure instantly becomes a game of “he said, she said,” but most people make up their minds about the truth before a woman even finishes her sentence. It’s the law requesting proof, when oftentimes, the damage took place years prior and all a woman has to show for it are invisible scars on her soul and those don’t hold up court. </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/how-sex-trafficking-goes-unnoticed-in-america/470166/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a $150 billion global human trafficking industry, including 4,000 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases per year in the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a person (whether a child, adult, male, female, trans, or an agender identifying person) feeling like their assault is either too shameful, too “trivial,” or too futile to report.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So here I am, saying “me too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I was assaulted in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It was an unseasonably warm afternoon and my husband and I had decided to go the pool to read. We found some tables in the shade to sit at and flipped open our books. We had only been there for 10 minutes when my husband spotted a man who lived in our apartment complex, whom we’d been formerly acquainted with, coming through the pool entrance gates. My husband warned me of this sighting and I instantly tensed up because our previous interactions with this man had left me very uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This man was extremely overly friendly, gave me very unsettling vibes, and to be honest — just seemed kind of off. I always tried to be polite to him when I would see him in a common area of the community, as did my husband, but we did our best to avoid this otherwise complete stranger if and when possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“It looks like he’s coming over here,” my husband said in a nervous, hushed tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As my back was facing this man, I did not see him approach, but I did hear his voice as he called out a greeting to my husband.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And then in an instant this man was behind me, with his left hand on my left shoulder and his right hand firmly cupping my right breast — like he belonged there. Like it was nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In a flash I can barely remember, my husband stood up and grabbed this man and pulled him away from me. I tried to steady my breath. My heart seemed to beat a million miles per second in the pit of my stomach. I was in complete shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The entire thing lasted perhaps 30 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After calling the police, we learned that there was a warrant out for this man’s arrest after he’d exposed himself to four underage girls at a public restaurant. He’d also assaulted various other women at the community pool in a similar manner that day. According to authorities, he suffers from mental illness and had stopped taking his medication and had been acting out as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The brief experience left me feeling scared, confused, guilty and upset.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Scared</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because I had done nothing to “entice” this man. I was fully clothed at the pool. In fact, I was wearing a sweater. I was also with my husband. I was surrounded by people. I was in a public setting. (So, if anyone tells you that you are dressing too provocatively, or that you shouldn’t go somewhere by yourself, or that it wouldn’t have happened if you weren’t drinking, or that you’re asking for it if you go to a private location with someone — I hope you tell them that it can happen anywhere, at any time, to anybody and to unlearn the bullshit they’ve been force-fed.) I found myself frequently checking the locks on all the windows and doors in our apartment and having anxiety each time I left my apartment alone.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Confused</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because I felt deeply violated by this man but also had sympathy for him because he wasn’t in a mental state to make the best decisions. Should I feel sorry for him? Should I hate him? Could both feelings coexist inside me simultaneously? Why did I now feel oddly linked to a complete stranger? It made me feel dirty.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Guilty</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because I was one of the “lucky” ones. My assault “really wasn’t that bad.” The experience didn’t last long. It was “just a boob tap.” There were even witnesses. It wasn’t like I had been raped. Why was I complaining? I should be grateful that this is the worst thing that’s happened to me because other women have had it so much worse.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Upset</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because well, I was assaulted. And it brought up memories. Memories that aren’t even my own.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">My mother was gang raped at the age of 19. Hers is not my story to tell, but it is a complicated and heart-wrenching one and it doesn’t have an ending. My mother’s experience has taught me that sexual assault does not have to write the chapters of your life, but it certainly influences them. It’s the reason she has an inherent need to be in control. It’s the reason she had a PTSD episode in a group boxing class in her 40s when she witnessed someone “defending” themselves against four assailants. It’s the reason she can’t watch certain television shows. It’s the reason she never let us have sleepovers growing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And it’s the reason why I took out a restraining order against the man who “barely” sexually assaulted me and testified against him in court. I did it for my mother. I did it for the four underage girls at a public restaurant who will forever have to remember a man’s unwanted advances. I did it for any potential women this man could have further assaulted had his behavior escalated. I did it for the girls and boys being molested in some dark corner, because it’s happening somewhere as I write this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I did it because one of my high school teachers put his hand on my back too often and once complimented me on my looks. I did it because a teenage boy once threw dollar bills at me as he catcalled me as I passed him by on the sidewalk. I did it for the time I was on a run and four men in a vehicle barked and howled at me as they wagged their tongues. I did it for the time I was walking a New York City sidewalk while eating a popsicle and a construction worker I passed by muttered that I “licked it so well” as the rest of his crew laughed. I did it for all the times I was called something derogatory for not reciprocating a man’s flirtations or for my refusal to dance with a man in a nightclub.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I did it for me. And I did it for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The man who assaulted me is being held accountable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The men who raped my mom got away with it. A lot of men do. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But they didn’t get away with my mom.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And we won’t let any man or assaulter get the best of us.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half the country is reveling in “sweater weather” right now, while the other half is still sporting sandals and cut-offs. If you fall into the latter group like me (no pun intended), it can be hard to feel festive for the season as pumpkin spice lattes and cozy blankets are a ways off.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re already donning those Nordstrom Anniversary Sale booties and enjoying the changing leaves or if you’re still eagerly anticipating your first brisk autumn morning, here are five ways to get into the spirit of the fall.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to The Civil Wars</span></h2>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this duo (tragically) parted ways in 2014, their music will forever live on. It’s moody AF and their beautiful blend transports you straight into a wooded, sleepy hollow type of dreamland that’s laced with longing and emotion. Or, at least that’s what it does for me. All of their music is available on Spotify.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat the </span><a href="https://www.krispykreme.com/menu/Doughnuts/PumpkinSpiceDoughnut"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin Spice Cake Donut</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Krispy Kreme</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1312" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="856" height="857" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut.png 856w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-150x150.png 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-300x300.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-768x769.png 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-80x80.png 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, don’t even argue with me about Dunkin versus Krispy because I WILL CUT YOU. (Just kidding.) But, I will use my knife to cut half of one of these babies and pretend like I’m not going to eat the whole thing and his 11 brothers and sisters in the box. Pumpkin is quintessentially fall (and in this case, only here for a limited time) and there’s nothing basic about loving a good thing.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read The Opposite of Loneliness</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1313" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="742" height="742" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book.png 742w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-150x150.png 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-300x300.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-80x80.png 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, summers are usually busy with vacations and trashy beach reads. As the sun starts setting earlier and I begin close out the year, I always like to read more thought-provoking material. </span></i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Opposite-Loneliness-Essays-Stories/dp/147675361X"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provokes insight from the work itself, but also because of the person who authored it. Marina Keegan, the young writer of this anthology, had just graduated Yale and landed a job at The New Yorker when she tragically died in a car accident five days after her graduation. These are the pages she left behind. And they’re good. Really damn good. </span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch Gilmore Girls (again) </span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1314" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="969" height="656" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls.png 969w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls-300x203.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re out on your own, feeling lonely, and so cold… All you have to do is call my name and I’ll be there, on the next train! Where you lead! I will follow! A-a-a-anywhere, that you tell me to!” *Cue fall foliage shot.* Start at the beginning, from Season 1, Episode 1, because it’s fall and Rory has a crush on a boy that we later discover is Dean (#teamJess over here btw) and her mother Lorelai is all like, “Does he have a motorcycle?” and thus begins the saga of the Gilmore Girls. The entire series is available on Netflix.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a Scenic Drive</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1315" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="975" height="650" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive.png 975w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive-300x200.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the leaves have changed or not, whether you live in a city or in the sticks, there’s nothing like rolling the windows down a bit and just going for a drive. No destination, no time commitment, just going. Some of the best conversations and best karaoke sessions happen on the wide open road. (Trust me, experience talking over here. There’s nothing like the safe confines of a vehicle to give you the confidence to go for that Mariah Carey high note.) So grab your keys and a friend and hit the road Jack(ie) —  and make sure you come back, with somemore, somemore, somemore, somemore — of those pumpkin spice donuts. </span></i></p>
