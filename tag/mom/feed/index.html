								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>From Cassie:</b></h3>
<p>My momma is one of the strongest people I know. She has endured so much in her lifetime but has always remained loyal, true and loving to me and my siblings. I admire her selflessness, her desire to serve and teach, and her ability to love wholeheartedly. All of what I’ve been able to accomplish has been attributed to her. My mom is the one who has encouraged me to become who I am today. She’s been my #1 fan from day one.</p>

<p>As I grow older I am able to better understand how much work really goes into motherhood. I am also just in awe that my mom was able to mother and nurture not only one, but four children. She’s pushed me to reach my biggest potential. At certain times in my life she’s believed in me more than I’ve believed in myself. And for that, I will forever be grateful.</p>
<p>When I think of my favorite childhood memories involving my mom I don’t think of just one instance or one particular event. I remember the everyday things involving her; talking to her for a half hour after high school every single day out on the porch when I came home, happily accompanying her to the grocery store (especially during prime sample times at Harris Teeter), or her being literally the loudest mom cheering me on when I ran track in middle school. I’m so fortunate to have a mom that has always been involved in the everyday things, big and small.</p>
<p>I love you mom. Thanks for being the best out there! Happy Mother’s Day! XOXO</p>

<h3><b>From Latisha:</b></h3>
<p>I’m the first born. This means I had time alone with my mom before any of my siblings came along; I’m the one who made her a mother. This makes me feel incredibly special because motherhood is not only the best role she’s ever played in life, but it’s also the one she is greatest at.</p>
<p>My mom had me 20 days before her 20th birthday. Though always wise beyond her years, she had barely entered into adulthood before the completely unexpected pregnancy re-charted the course of her life. It forced her to mature more quickly than she already had been. It required sacrifice and selflessness and a lot of faith, all of which she has continuously exhibited for the past two and a half decades I have been blessed to call her mom.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/memom.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-100  aligncenter" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/memom.jpg" alt="memom" width="571" height="420" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/memom.jpg 640w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/memom-300x221.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /></a></p>
<p>Sometimes I feel guilty, because she has given so much of herself to me and my siblings that she’s almost forgotten how to put herself first. Now an empty-nester, she’s relearning how to do this and I want to be her biggest advocate in doing so because she was always mine.</p>
<p>Motherhood is more than just “having a baby.” It’s bringing life into this world. It’s being legally responsible for that human being for the first 18 years of its life and emotionally cognizant of him/her for the rest of forever.</p>
<p>My mom is my home.</p>
<p>Happy Mother’s Day to all the women who are raising or have raised the souls entrusted to you.</p>
