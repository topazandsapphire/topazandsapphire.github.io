								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me just start with this: yes I quit my job. Yes, by definition, that makes me a quitter. But if you know me even just as an acquaintance you know that I am by no means a &#8220;quitter&#8221;.</p>
<p>Every night after getting off of work I felt drained mentally, physically, and emotionally. I was working in a position that inhibited my creativity and stunted my professional growth. On top of that, my philosophies didn&#8217;t fit well with the company&#8217;s so I often felt frustrated, which left me with a continuous sense of internal conflict. Ultimately I realized this company and I were not a great fit for each other and I decided that I needed to move on.</p>
<p>I learned a ton from my most recent employer &#8211; skills that will stay with me forever. I have no regrets about moving cross-country to start this job or for working there the past nine months. In fact, if I didn&#8217;t have this experience at my job I wouldn&#8217;t know what I really wanted out of my career moving forward.</p>
<h3>I left my job for one main reason: I wasn&#8217;t happy.</h3>
<p>Living a life that lacks happiness is no way to live. For me, a job just isn&#8217;t something that I do to pay the bills. I work because I want to. I work because it gives me a sense of purpose and shapes me into the person I want to be. I work to feel like I am giving back to the world in some small way. I work to make a difference.</p>
<p>I know so many people who are unhappy with their jobs, where they are in life, who they are becoming, etc. My one word of advice to you is: CHANGE! <em>Change</em> your job, <em>change</em> where you are in your life, <em>change</em> who you are becoming, <em>change</em> your attitude. What are you waiting for?</p>
<p>Darren Hardy, author of The Compound Effect, couldn&#8217;t have said it any better, &#8220;Everything you need to be great is already inside of you. Stop waiting for someone or something to light your fire, you have the match.&#8221; And that is one of the many reasons I quit my job.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-933 size-full aligncenter" src="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fitness-Routine-Topaz-Sapphire.jpg" alt="Darren Hardy quote - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="735" height="1102" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fitness-Routine-Topaz-Sapphire.jpg 735w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fitness-Routine-Topaz-Sapphire-200x300.jpg 200w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fitness-Routine-Topaz-Sapphire-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></p>
<p>I have the ambition, the drive, and the motivation to (hopefully) do so many great things. Why was I waiting around for someone to get me to that point? I needed to take control of my own happiness, my own life, and my own career.</p>
<p>I quit my job without having anything lined up.</p>
<h3>I quit my job not because I am a quitter, but because I am a go-getter.</h3>
<p>I quit so I could be free to chase my dreams. I quit so I could invite positivity and strength back into my life. I quit so that I could be happy; so I could live up to my true potential. Quitting my job was the best thing I could have ever done.</p>
<p>Who knows what the next step in my career will hold &#8211; only time will tell! For now, I will indulge in the extra time to expand my horizons, explore my talents, try new things, find new friendships, and invest in old ones.</p>
