					<description><![CDATA[youre ballsy! on the plane manifest it specifically shows us which passengers have dogs. as long as you have a chill flight crew, they wont say anything. however, ive worked with many flight attendants that check this hard core and that results in being kicked off the flight and a hefty fine.

I always recommend to friends to just make your dog an emotional support animal. Super easy to get your doctor to write up an rx and then its no more than $65 to register. That way you never have to pay a fee AND you can hold your dog the whole flight! 

peace of mind + free puppy flying!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow - I&#039;ve traveled with pets  but never by air because I&#039;ve always been too nervous to do so. This is a great post - very reassuring and encouraging so maybe I&#039;ll give it a try next time I need to. Thanks.]]></description>
