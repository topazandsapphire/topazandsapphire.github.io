								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gym memberships are great, but they can also be expensive. Even though I love working out in the gym, I canceled my gym membership last winter because I just didn&#8217;t feel like I was using it enough for the cost. Conversely, I also have friends who hate the gym and feel like &#8220;hamsters on a wheel.&#8221; Whatever the reason, you may or may not have a gym membership, but working out in the gym isn&#8217;t the only way to break a sweat! Here are five ways you can get a great workout in, sans gym.</p>
<h2>YouTube workouts</h2>
<p>YouTube has thousands of workouts literally available at your fingertips. The trick is knowing which ones are worth your while.</p>
<p>A girlfriend turned me on to &#8220;my boy&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yaboymillhoy" target="_blank">Millionaire Hoy</a>. His workouts are challenging and efficient and will have you dripping in no time. He posts new workouts every week so you never get bored and he is incredibly funny throughout the sweat sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1011"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1011" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-13 at 4.11.32 PM" width="861" height="471" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM.png 861w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM-300x164.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM-768x420.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 861px) 100vw, 861px" /></a></p>
<p>For zumba lovers, try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HtqocGqqoQ" target="_blank">this</a> 4 minute dance routine.</p>
<p>For those into hip-hop dancing, try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdPEO599wVg&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=ZxT7kK5Gygk&amp;annotation_id=annotation_2919342847" target="_blank">this</a> dance routine, which takes you through step-by-step choreography.</p>
<p>Yogis- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene" target="_blank">Yoga with Adriene</a>. She has over 1 million subscribers to her channel.</p>
<h2>Going to the park</h2>
<p>A simple jog never hurt nobody, and it&#8217;s better and more challenging than running on a treadmill. Take it up a notch by going to a nearby park. Jogging around the park will provide you with great scenery and more challenging terrain.</p>
<p>Parks are also great places to do sprints, lunges, squats, pull-ups (on the monkey bars), and more&#8230; In my neighborhood there is actually an &#8220;outdoor recreation jungle gym&#8221; that shows you how to use the equipment.</p>
<p>Several parks in the Raleigh-Durham area also have canoe and kayak rentals. Both provide a great upper arm workout and beautiful scenery. If you live in the RDU area check out <a href="https://www.raleighnc.gov/parks/content/ParksRec/Articles/Parks/LakeJohnson.html" target="_blank">Lake Johnson</a>. Kayak rentals are just $5 an hour.</p>
<p>Look up your local parks and recreation website to see what options your city provides and don&#8217;t be afraid to get creative!</p>
<h2>Playing a sport</h2>
<p>One my favorite ways to get some cardio (and some serious laughs in) is to play tennis. I&#8217;m no good, so chasing all the balls I miss gets my heart racing. (Not the point of the game, but cardiovascular efficient). I&#8217;m terrible, but I love it because I feel like I&#8217;m getting exercise, while also learning a new skill.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re super athletic and want to play team sports competitively, more power to you. But you don&#8217;t have to be an all-star to hit the courts/fields- whether to shoot a basket, kick around a soccer ball, or play a summer game of baseball a la Sandlot.</p>
<h2>At home workouts</h2>
<p>These kind of go along with YouTube workouts, but if you want to work more independently while pumping up your tunes, you can hop on the &#8220;at home workout&#8221; train.</p>
<p>One WILDLY popular at-home fitness package is by Australian workout guru Kayla Itsines, creator of her &#8220;<a href="http://www.kaylaitsines.com/collections/guides?gclid=Cj0KEQiAvJS3BRDd44fjndyii6MBEiQAN4EkPaBmTh8vOE9rtU-faIH2TTV5Oz9f7B9bq4ir8w2yKCAaAlsc8P8HAQ" target="_blank">bikini body guide</a>.&#8221; You pay for a digital download of her fitness and nutrition program, but can repeat the entire program again and again. It transitions with you as you get stronger. You can do the workouts from the comfort of your own home (or a gym). She has 4.6 million followers on Instagram and her client before/after photos speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Sadie of the blog <a href="http://simplysadiejane.com/category/fitness" target="_blank">Simply Sadie Jane</a> frequently blogs about fitness and provides workouts you can do from your living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/topaznsapphire/health-fitness/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> is also a great way to search for workouts you can do from home. Everything from yoga, to cardio, to circuits, and more.</p>
<h2>Workout apps</h2>
<h4>Nike Training Club</h4>
<p>NTC is a free app from the app store that you can download on your phone. You can choose your workout level and what type of workout you want (abs, cardio, arms, etc.) It also has videos of how to properly do the moves in correct form. It even links with your music library on your phone if you want to play some jams while you workout.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1014"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1014" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820-599x1024.png" alt="IMG_3966" width="599" height="1024" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820-599x1024.png 599w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820-175x300.png 175w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></a></p>
<h4>Rock My Run</h4>
<p>This app provides music mixes for running. You can choose the length (say you&#8217;re going on a 35 minute run) and the tempo of the music (say you&#8217;re going to go at a moderate pace, you&#8217;d pick something with a moderate tempo).</p>

<p>How do you guys <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/5-tips-to-help-you-stick-to-your-fitness-routine/">get fit</a> outside of the gym? Are there any apps we should know about?

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Leslie Woods</p>
<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Director of Operations/Juice Pusher, Raleigh Raw</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 28</p>
<p><strong>Resides:</strong> Raleigh, N.C.</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong> B.A., Psychology and Cognitive Science, NCSU. Master&#8217;s, Global Innovation Management, NCSU.</p>
<p>Leslie Woods of Raleigh Raw juice and her business partner Sherif Fouad (who doubles as her boyfriend) are opening their first brick and mortar cafe next month in downtown Raleigh, N.C. Initially a door-delivery service, Woods and Fouad raised almost $40,000 via Kickstarter to make their dream come true, which shows how much the local community believes in their mission to “Fuel the Hustle.”</p>
<p>“(It’s about) providing the best quality foods and beverages to the community in a convenient way so they can get on with their day feeling their best and thereby producing and creating at their highest level,” Leslie said.</p>
<p>Raleigh Raw is 100 percent organic and raw. Juices are cold and fresh pressed. The cafe will also provide pre-packaged foods (made fresh daily), oatmeal, and local coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve helped to create a place where people on a similar frequency can come to connect, discuss ideas, and live the best versions of themselves,&#8221; Leslie said. &#8220;The business began in Sherif’s kitchen in downtown Raleigh. He had been laid off in NYC during the market downturn in 2012 and moved to Raleigh to get a fresh start. We met at the bar I was managing&#8230; (Eventually) we were living together and basically on the same schedule- work on the weekends and search for your passion during the week. He started making juices for the neighbors and was set on starting a juice company. He knew he could create an outstanding product. I watched him work, passionately creating juices and trying to find a partner, but no one seemed to be the right fit.  Over time he would ask me to help him do this or that&#8230;The process naturally grew into us working together everyday and eventually it made sense that he write me into the operating agreement and we make it official. We’re very blessed to have the relationship that we do. It is rare for sure and we’re grateful everyday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Read on for our interview with Leslie.</p>

<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What were some of your previous jobs before Raleigh Raw? (Basically tell us about your career journey and how you ended up where you are).</span></i></h3>
<p><strong>LW: </strong>College Years: During my time at NCSU (North Carolina State University) I worked in all aspects of the restaurant industry &#8211; hostess, busser, waiter, cocktail waitress, bartender, manager.</p>
<p>Post Grad School: I began working at Lenovo Computer Company in (Research Triangle Park) in 2011 and knew I had made it! All of those talks you&#8217;ve been given as a kid about what true success is… “Go to school, get a good stable job, get married, buy a house, have kids, etc.” At about six months in, the veil of shine began to lift and I came to understand that I no longer knew what I wanted out of a career, or out of life. I felt tricked- I had worked so hard for what someone else told me was the right thing to do; the right career path to follow. I stuck it out for another six months.  I knew that this lifestyle did not suit who I was and headstrong at 23 years old, I knew I would never go back.</p>
<p>Post Corporate Job: I left Lenovo in June of 2012 with no real plans. I knew I had my service industry family to lean on and they all came through. I was able to get a bartending job on the weekends and make enough to support myself through the weeks. I was confident that I could start my own business and make money at it but I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to produce or offer as a service. I&#8217;m very driven and will outwork most people that I know so (I thought) why should I spend my resources spinning someone else’s wheels when I can spin my own and keep all of the profits? In order to find this idea I set up some parameters: 1. (The venture) must not require start-up capital. 2. (It) must not require a physical store. 3. (It) must have high profits. I hadn’t defined this further at that time because, to be honest, I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing!  Out of those guidelines I created, along with a now very close friend, The Factory NC.  We were an online shop to buy local North Carolina creations &#8211; an Etsy on a local scale. There was potential there.  It was year one of business number one and in any new business that year is more of (a) learning (experience) than making money. We both decided it was time to fold the business. My father, a self-employed engineer, said to me, “Leslie, if you’re not making money then this is a hobby, not a business.” He was right, it was a hobby.</p>
<p>Post The Factory NC: I had now successfully gotten a master’s degree, landed a great corporate job, quit said corporate job after one year, went back to bartending, and failed at my first business. From the outside in, I was not looking too hot.  But from the inside looking out I knew I was on the right track. I was getting closer to something…</p>
<p><strong>Leslie would later meet Sherif and the rest is history. </strong></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juicing has become very popular; what sets Raleigh Raw apart and/or makes it different? </span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>We go overboard when it comes to product quality and consistency.  If you drink a Raleigh Raw juice in April 2014 and then again in April 2017 it will taste the exact same.  This is our passion project. We are not here to make loads of profits (you cannot reasonably expect to do so in an organic health food company), we are here to provide the best possible product to our community – product over profits. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>How have you seen the power of juice and/or healthy foods impact your own life and the lives of others? </i></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>Sherif’s father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012 and has remained in remission using raw foods, without chemo or radiation!! I mean, that&#8217;s huge. For others and for ourselves when you drink a juice or a superfood smoothie you get a jolt of energy, your body springs back to life.  As Sherif notes, “We’re live bodies and so we need live foods.” Uncooked plant based foods is what Raleigh Raw offers. </span></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You recently raised almost $40,000 via Kickstarter to help fund the opening of your cafe. Tell us more about this experience and what people can expect from the cafe once it opens. </span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>It was a humbling experience. When we launched the Kickstarter we both immediately agreed that we should take it down, that it was unrealistic. We had a huge show of support from customers, friends, and family. It gave us a tremendous amount of confidence to move forward. The café is almost open!! We’re aiming for March 1, 2016. The Raleigh Raw Café is going to be a place for grab-and-go food, coffees and teas, as well as a hub for conscious conversation. The foods will be made that morning and prepackaged for quick and convenient pick up.  Our menu items will include salad, soup, smoothies, juice, no-bread wraps, snack boxes with hummus and vegetables, oatmeal, etc… We will be serving an amazing tea menu provided by Sangha Tea House in Durham, as well as Matcha from Panatea, and coffee from Raleigh Coffee Co. We plan to have many monthly events where speakers will join us. This is something that Raleigh needs and we are so thankful to be a part of it. </span></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What piece of advice would you give to someone looking to start their own brand or business?</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>Follow your gut. Take others’ advice with a grain of salt. Find yourself a badass mentor and ask them to coach you. ALWAYS believe in yourself because what you have to offer matters. </span></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell us about Raleigh and the greater Triad area. What do you love about it and what are some of your favorite hot spots? </span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>I’m the Raleigh almanac.  I have a deep-rooted love for this large town (I&#8217;m not ready to call Raleigh a city yet but we’re getting there). The Raleigh community is incredibly giving and supportive. There is a large group of entrepreneurial-minded individuals who live in this area who are ready to pitch in and brainstorm new ideas. The support from these groups to start something for yourself is unmatched. Some of my favorite spots to hang are Lake Johnson, Capital Club 16, Fox Liquor Bar, and of course Raleigh Raw Café. </span></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most memorable #girlboss moment to date:</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>LW: </strong>When our current landlord declined to give us the space for the café.  I got the phone call from our broker and instead of getting sad or saying, “Damn, that sucks.” I said, “No, not happening. Call an all hands meeting tomorrow. I want the owner, the building manager, their lawyer, and both of you (my brokers) all there at noon.” … The brokers arranged it and I stayed up all night creating a 20-page document that detailed our plans, the demographics of the area, and the vision for the space. After the meeting all parties involved were blown away and said it was one of the best pitches they’d ever seen. A day later we got the call we were in.  It was one of those moments where you stand up for yourself, when you know that something belongs to you and you protect it as if someone is trying to take it from you.  </span></p>
