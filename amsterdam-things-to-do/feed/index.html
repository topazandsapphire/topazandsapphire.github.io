					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been about 15 years since I was in Amsterdam. I really want to go back and experience it again. We were there in April and one thing I really remember is how cold it was (so I can only imagine how cold it must have been in December!). Yet, all the local were still riding their bikes everywhere, most with no gloves and just a light jacket (while I wore two of everything trying to stay warm!).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh I would definitely recommend going. I&#039;ve been several places in Europe and this was one of my favorites. Not to mention, everyone commutes via bike so it makes seeing the city really easy! We stayed for 6 days. But 4 out of those days I was working remotely during the day and only had time to explore in the evenings on those days. I would say a solid 3-4 days would be plenty to see and do all the things you want to!]]></description>
