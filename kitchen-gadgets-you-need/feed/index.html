					<description><![CDATA[Oh heck yes, I couldn&#039;t agree more!  I just LOVE my KitchenAid mixer, it&#039;s heaven. Alas I don&#039;t use it as often as I should because my husband didn&#039;t want it sitting on the bench (he likes to hog all the bench space), but you&#039;ve given me renewed hope in putting my case forward. It sits on the bottom shelf of our pantry and is way too heavy for me to bring up.

My husband was a chef in a former life, so he has a love affair for his chopping boards. We were gifted a beautiful end grain one as a wedding gift Kat last year, but he hasn&#039;t oiled it yet, so we wet haven&#039;t used it. I must remind him to do so.
Instead, he will prep on our Ikea wooden bench top butchers block on wheels. He loves that thing, it was the best $12 eBay purchase ever.

What we don&#039;t have though is a chopper or a blender. A chopper isn&#039;t needed because Alex is one of those people who goes chop chop chop chop chop and looks at you while you confine your conversation (did I mention I&#039;m not the cook in our household!? Baker, on the other hand...)
We are in the market though for a blender and a food processor. It will make our lives so much easier in all areas of food prep when our baby arrives.

As for what kitchen gadget can&#039;t I live without, I&#039;m really not sure. I used to be a Tupperware consultant 10 years ago so I do love my Tupperware, but definitely can&#039;t single out one thing.]]></description>
