					<description><![CDATA[I love love love this post. I definitely think we are all in a career rut at one time or another and it may last days or months or even years. One thing I find that has helped me is giving my current job more of a chance... if things aren&#039;t how I want them to be, I try my best to speak up to management and get some things changed. If that doesn&#039;t work out, then I know that I&#039;ve tried and I can go somewhere else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Toward the end of my corporate career as I became increasingly dissatisfied with working for someone else (I&#039;m not good at taking orders it turns out after all these years)I decided to go back to school part time - while keeping my job. I was in a total rut but simply applying for jobs wasn&#039;t helping because I knew the problem was as much with what I wanted as it was the job I had - and simply changing location wasn&#039;t going to solve the issue. Within two months of beginning my study I had quit my job and was studying and freelancing full time. It was the  best decision I ever made. By opting to study part time I gave myself enough of a distraction from the career frustration to actually *think* about what I wanted to do next.  Since then, I&#039;ve spoken with several colleagues and found that&#039;s what they needed too - not necessarily to go back to school - but something to remove their focus from the &quot;this is all wrong and I hate it&quot; long enough to figure out &quot;I don&#039;t like this, I do like that, and I want to be ....&quot; after which it was less challenging to begin taking steps toward a solution. 
Great post - thanks.]]></description>
