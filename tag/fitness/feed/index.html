								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gym memberships are great, but they can also be expensive. Even though I love working out in the gym, I canceled my gym membership last winter because I just didn&#8217;t feel like I was using it enough for the cost. Conversely, I also have friends who hate the gym and feel like &#8220;hamsters on a wheel.&#8221; Whatever the reason, you may or may not have a gym membership, but working out in the gym isn&#8217;t the only way to break a sweat! Here are five ways you can get a great workout in, sans gym.</p>
<h2>YouTube workouts</h2>
<p>YouTube has thousands of workouts literally available at your fingertips. The trick is knowing which ones are worth your while.</p>
<p>A girlfriend turned me on to &#8220;my boy&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yaboymillhoy" target="_blank">Millionaire Hoy</a>. His workouts are challenging and efficient and will have you dripping in no time. He posts new workouts every week so you never get bored and he is incredibly funny throughout the sweat sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1011"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1011" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-13 at 4.11.32 PM" width="861" height="471" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM.png 861w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM-300x164.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM-768x420.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 861px) 100vw, 861px" /></a></p>
<p>For zumba lovers, try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HtqocGqqoQ" target="_blank">this</a> 4 minute dance routine.</p>
<p>For those into hip-hop dancing, try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdPEO599wVg&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=ZxT7kK5Gygk&amp;annotation_id=annotation_2919342847" target="_blank">this</a> dance routine, which takes you through step-by-step choreography.</p>
<p>Yogis- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene" target="_blank">Yoga with Adriene</a>. She has over 1 million subscribers to her channel.</p>
<h2>Going to the park</h2>
<p>A simple jog never hurt nobody, and it&#8217;s better and more challenging than running on a treadmill. Take it up a notch by going to a nearby park. Jogging around the park will provide you with great scenery and more challenging terrain.</p>
<p>Parks are also great places to do sprints, lunges, squats, pull-ups (on the monkey bars), and more&#8230; In my neighborhood there is actually an &#8220;outdoor recreation jungle gym&#8221; that shows you how to use the equipment.</p>
<p>Several parks in the Raleigh-Durham area also have canoe and kayak rentals. Both provide a great upper arm workout and beautiful scenery. If you live in the RDU area check out <a href="https://www.raleighnc.gov/parks/content/ParksRec/Articles/Parks/LakeJohnson.html" target="_blank">Lake Johnson</a>. Kayak rentals are just $5 an hour.</p>
<p>Look up your local parks and recreation website to see what options your city provides and don&#8217;t be afraid to get creative!</p>
<h2>Playing a sport</h2>
<p>One my favorite ways to get some cardio (and some serious laughs in) is to play tennis. I&#8217;m no good, so chasing all the balls I miss gets my heart racing. (Not the point of the game, but cardiovascular efficient). I&#8217;m terrible, but I love it because I feel like I&#8217;m getting exercise, while also learning a new skill.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re super athletic and want to play team sports competitively, more power to you. But you don&#8217;t have to be an all-star to hit the courts/fields- whether to shoot a basket, kick around a soccer ball, or play a summer game of baseball a la Sandlot.</p>
<h2>At home workouts</h2>
<p>These kind of go along with YouTube workouts, but if you want to work more independently while pumping up your tunes, you can hop on the &#8220;at home workout&#8221; train.</p>
<p>One WILDLY popular at-home fitness package is by Australian workout guru Kayla Itsines, creator of her &#8220;<a href="http://www.kaylaitsines.com/collections/guides?gclid=Cj0KEQiAvJS3BRDd44fjndyii6MBEiQAN4EkPaBmTh8vOE9rtU-faIH2TTV5Oz9f7B9bq4ir8w2yKCAaAlsc8P8HAQ" target="_blank">bikini body guide</a>.&#8221; You pay for a digital download of her fitness and nutrition program, but can repeat the entire program again and again. It transitions with you as you get stronger. You can do the workouts from the comfort of your own home (or a gym). She has 4.6 million followers on Instagram and her client before/after photos speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Sadie of the blog <a href="http://simplysadiejane.com/category/fitness" target="_blank">Simply Sadie Jane</a> frequently blogs about fitness and provides workouts you can do from your living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/topaznsapphire/health-fitness/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> is also a great way to search for workouts you can do from home. Everything from yoga, to cardio, to circuits, and more.</p>
<h2>Workout apps</h2>
<h4>Nike Training Club</h4>
<p>NTC is a free app from the app store that you can download on your phone. You can choose your workout level and what type of workout you want (abs, cardio, arms, etc.) It also has videos of how to properly do the moves in correct form. It even links with your music library on your phone if you want to play some jams while you workout.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1014"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1014" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820-599x1024.png" alt="IMG_3966" width="599" height="1024" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820-599x1024.png 599w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820-175x300.png 175w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></a></p>
<h4>Rock My Run</h4>
<p>This app provides music mixes for running. You can choose the length (say you&#8217;re going on a 35 minute run) and the tempo of the music (say you&#8217;re going to go at a moderate pace, you&#8217;d pick something with a moderate tempo).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been wanting to train for a half marathon for forever. I&#8217;ve started, I&#8217;ve stopped, I&#8217;ve thought about it, I stopped thinking about it. For a while I think I only wanted to do it because it was &#8220;trendy.&#8221; Well rule #1 you&#8217;ll probably never be able to do something if it&#8217;s for someone else but yourself.</p>
<p>I started training for my half about a month ago, and I will be brutally honest: it. is. freaking. rough. The humidity, the hills, the heat = triple threat against building endurance and adding mileage. Even with all of these factors trying to stop me from running, I have seen HUGE improvements since I started training a little while ago.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-446 size-full" title="Half Marathon Tips" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Everything-you-have-ever-wanted-is-sitting.png" alt="Half Marathon Tips" width="560" height="315" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Everything-you-have-ever-wanted-is-sitting.png 560w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Everything-you-have-ever-wanted-is-sitting-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p>Here are a few tips that have helped me stick to my half-marathon training routine:</p>
<h2>1. Weekly Preparation</h2>
<p>Running is totally mental. I&#8217;m still trying to overcome some mental roadblocks, but every week it gets easier. I&#8217;ve found that if I plan my week ahead and consciously know how much I need to run or cross train every day then I am more mentally prepared to run X amount of miles each day of the week. Prepare your week accordingly. If I have plans after work I try and run in the mornings, and vice versa. Don&#8217;t make excuses and say you can&#8217;t find the time to run. If you have an hour to spare to watch a show or scroll through Insta, you have time to fit in a run.</p>
<h2>2. Invest in Good Running Shoes</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running 12-15 miles per week in my Nike Frees. I didn&#8217;t really think it was a problem until my feet started hurting and I started talking to some real runners. When you&#8217;re running constantly you want to make sure you have supportive shoes made for running long distances. Good shoes can help you avoid foot injuries and can make for an overall running experience. I&#8217;ve only done a few runs in my <a href="http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/air-zoom-pegasus-32-running-shoe/pid-10265303/pgid-10265304">new shoes</a> but it&#8217;s already a step in the right direction, and my feet feel so much better!</p>
<p>If  you&#8217;re in the Raleigh area, go to <a href="http://www.fleetfeetraleigh.com/">Fleet Feet</a> &#8211; they took 45 minutes with me trying to find the best running shoe that best fit me according to my walk, foot, and comfort level.</p>
<h2>3. Find a few Running Buddies</h2>
<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve learned that the only person you can rely on is yourself when it comes to working out or running or really anything. I&#8217;m doing this half marathon all on my own and I take pride that I&#8217;m not relying on others to get me on my feet; however, the occasional running buddy has made all the difference. A couple of times a week I run with a friend or go to a <a href="http://houseofhopsnc.com/running-club">nearby running club</a>. Because of my competitive nature, I find running with others helps me push my limits and makes it more of a social thing. It helps to have others to run with to change things up!</p>
<h2>4. Pick a Playlist</h2>
<p>I need all the <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/the-best-workout-playlist-for-90s-babies/">best pump up jams</a> that have fast tempos to keep me motivated, especially when running up those rolling Raleigh hills. Good fast music, for me, has made all the difference. It literally blocks out the hurt, the heavy breathing, and straining leg muscles and good music really helps me take it up a notch.</p>
<h2>5. Drink A LOT of Water</h2>
<p>Keeping hydrated is key for running longer distances. I wear out way faster if I don&#8217;t drink my 6 water bottles a day before an evening jog. In fact, a few weeks ago I went to run club with some coworkers after work and ended up having to call Brady to come pick me up mid run because I felt like I was going to pass out any minute. That day I had only drank like one water bottle of water earlier that morning, and man did my body feel the difference. Never doing that again!</p>
<h2>6. Choose a Destination Race</h2>
<p>As mentioned before I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a half marathon but for me it was hard to find the motivation to actually stick to the training and get past week 2. A huge motivator for me for running this half is because I&#8217;ve chosen a race in a place I&#8217;ve always wanted to visit &#8211; Nantucket! It&#8217;s a good enough excuse to go there and it&#8217;s definitely keeping me head in the game to keep up with training.</p>
<h2>7. Find a Cheerleader</h2>
<p>Brady has been one of my biggest supporters since I&#8217;ve started training. Some days when running seems too hard, Brady always finds a way to encourage me to get out the door. He&#8217;s never pushy, he just knows exactly what to say, &#8220;Cassie if you go don&#8217;t go today you&#8217;ll regret it tomorrow,&#8221; or, &#8220;I&#8217;ll even run with you tonight if you want!&#8221; (Ps Brady doesn&#8217;t believe in running, so that&#8217;s huge that he would even think of going with me!) Having a strong support system makes a big difference because on the days I don&#8217;t believe in myself, someone out there (Brady) still does.</p>
<h2>8. Change up your Route</h2>
<p>If you know me, I need change in my life to keep things fresh. This totally applies to running too. Changing up my route has kept things exciting on my run and has helped my legs become stronger because different terrain = different muscles.</p>

<p>I have a love-hate relationship with exercise. (Love the results, hate every minute of it).</p>
<p>One way I can better my workout experience is if I have some tunes to keep me pumped and going. I recently put together a playlist that I am really diggin&#8217; at the moment. Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/latishacatch/playlist/1NjMD2gzFVuny62B4vhVv6" target="_blank">here</a> to listen to it or download it on Spotify.</p>
<p>Hit play &amp; get your sweat on!<br />
<center><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:latishacatch:playlist:1NjMD2gzFVuny62B4vhVv6" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center></p>
<p>WARNING: If you do not enjoy 90s R&amp;B then you probably won&#8217;t like this playlist. But if you don&#8217;t like 90s R&amp;B you&#8217;re probably not human either&#8230;</p>
<p>(P.S. Even though I was born in the 80s, I was raised on 90s music. This playlist is inspired by hits of the decade and artists who were hot during that time period and are still producing great records, with the addition of a few new-school joints).</p>
