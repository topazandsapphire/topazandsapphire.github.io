					<description><![CDATA[It sounds a little silly, but what gets me motivated is reading blog posts like this one, or fitness magazine tips. I really hate working out (I have some physical limitations AND I am naturally a couch potato on top of that!), but I always get way more motivated when I read posts like this! Thank you!]]></description>
