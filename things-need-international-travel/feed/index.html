					<description><![CDATA[Great post! I&#039;m currently studying abroad in Australia and I have to agree all these things are very important, although I tend just to use IMessage or Facebook messenger when talking to friends! 

I have a few posts on my blog as well about tips for studying abroad and traveling as well! 
Feel free to check it out!
