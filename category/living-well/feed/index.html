								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each new year offers the opportunity to become a better you &#8211; to reset and reevaluate goals. As we begin 2019, I&#8217;ve decided to share my 2019 mantras with all of you. By sharing my goals I hope to inspire you to set some of your own, so we can work together to be the women we&#8217;re proudest to be.</p>
<p>As in years past, I have chosen to stick to two <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/a-new-year-a-new-motto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">words to live by</a>: &#8220;consistency&#8221; and &#8220;unstoppable.&#8221; These words will dictate the overarching theme of my specific goals this year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1500" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Through <strong>consistency </strong>I hope to build better and sustainable habits, while <strong>unstoppable </strong>encompasses all the bucket list items I wish to cross off this year. My only rule for creating my bucket list is that it can&#8217;t include anything I&#8217;ve already planned or booked already. (For example, if you signed up to run a half marathon in 2018 that takes place in 2019, you shouldn&#8217;t write &#8220;run a half marathon&#8221; on your list.)</p>
<p>Below are few examples of sub-goals and bucket list items I have made under each mantra. For me, making goals specific helps me to better follow through.</p>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Less sugar. Think of desserts as a treat or something special, versus an everyday snack I&#8217;m entitled to</li>
<li>Build a better nightly routine</li>
<li>Less mobile media consumption &#8211; i.e. 40 minutes of Instagram per day</li>
<li>Journal more (at least 2x per month)</li>
<li>Go to bed each night with a clean kitchen</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unstoppable</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visit 12 new cities or unfamiliar places</li>
<li>Read 20 books</li>
<li>Visit 1 new country</li>
<li>Complete 1 photo project</li>
<li>Join some sort of hobby-related club</li>
<li>Send 2 snail mail letters per month</li>
</ul>
<p>While this isn&#8217;t an all encompassing list, hopefully some of these things can help you spark ideas for goals or bucket list items  your own. It&#8217;s understood that not all individuals are the same and do not set or establish goals the same way. For me, writing down a list of things holds me accountable. Rather than living by a mantra, you may prefer creating a bucket list or creating monthly goals vs. yearly goals.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1502" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>However setting goals looks for you &#8211; embrace it! There is no right or wrong way to set goals. My only tip for setting New Year&#8217;s resolutions is to tell at least one other person your goals, whether that&#8217;s your mom, roomie, significant other, dog, etc. Telling someone else helps you feel more committed to your goals and gives you a greater sense of accountability in order to accomplish them. And remember, it&#8217;s never too late to set goals!</p>
<h2>The Importance of Setting Goals</h2>
<p>Setting goals has always been so important to me. With an <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achiever personality</a>, a lot of my self-satisfaction comes from achieving something, even if it&#8217;s small. Even without this type of personality, I find almost <em>all</em> people, whether they know it or not, feel their best when they have accomplished something they have worked toward. Whether that&#8217;s sleep training your baby, getting that promotion at work, or learning to bake a fluffy chocolate chip cookie &#8211; anytime you&#8217;re accomplishing something as an individual are moments you can look back on with fondness. Some of our proudest moments in life are when we&#8217;ve successfully completed something we&#8217;ve set our minds to accomplish or improve in ourselves, which is why it&#8217;s so important to set goals &#8211; big and small!</p>

<h3>A Special Shout Out to Our Readers</h3>

We want this blog to serve as an inspirational and educational platform, and we can&#8217;t do that without all of you &#8211; so thank you to all of you as readers and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/topazandsapphire/">followers</a>.</p>

While I am by no means a fashionista, I do enjoy shopping (what woman doesn't love a little retail therapy) and expressing myself through the clothes that I wear. I love that fall fashion allows you to mix textures, prints, and layers without having to worry about bundling up for freezing temperatures, or losing layers for hot muggy summers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though a self-proclaimed summer girl, I have to say there&#8217;s something so magical about the fall. The glow of the trees as the leaves change from green to yellow and orange to red, the crisp mornings, and the fog that hovers over the Puget Sound horizon are all some of my favorite things about autumn in Washington. No matter where I am living though, my love for fall fashion remains the same! While I am by no means a fashionista, I do enjoy shopping (what woman doesn&#8217;t love a little retail therapy) and expressing myself through the clothes that I wear. I love that fall fashion allows you to mix textures, prints, and layers without having to worry about bundling up for freezing temperatures, or losing layers for hot muggy summers.</p>
<p>This season I&#8217;m <em>falling </em>for cheetah print. I&#8217;ve always been a leopard print fan, but I&#8217;m loving all of the new ways I&#8217;m seeing it styled and used in different wardrobe pieces. Cheetah has definitely progressed from being a statement piece to more of a neutral in my eyes. So, for all of my cheetah sisters out there, I&#8217;ve rounded up all of my favorite cheetah print autumn wardrobe staples, all under $150!<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the start of this year, I’ve focused less on resolutions and more on resolving to do and be better in general. Goals are great, but <b>habits are what bring about real change</b>. After all, goals are successfully attained as the result of habituated actions that help you reach them. I decided to focus more on changing certain habits and less on measurable goals, to see what happened. The result? An overall happier me. Here are six simple changes I made to my mentality, my routine, or my daily habits that have truly changed me for the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Going to bed at a set time &amp; waking up with positive intentions</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1400" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-300x300.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-768x768.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-80x80.jpg 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_QXRZLX36A5-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>I am a natural night-owl, which usually makes for rough mornings. It’s especially hard for me to turn in at a decent hour on days where I feel like my whole day has been comprised of work and errands. I’d rather stay up to get in some much-needed “me” time. However, the gains don’t compensate for the losses I take the next day — in mood, energy level, or productivity. As an adult, it’s seems counterintuitive to give yourself a bedtime, but it’s worked wonders for me.</p>
<p>Going hand-in-hand with a decent bedtime, is getting up on the right side of the bed each morning. I do my best to wake up with positive intentions for the day, rather than grumble about work, the weather, wanting to sleep in, or any other negativity that may come all too easily when my soft sheets are begging me to stay. I say <i>intentions, </i>because life is not perfect and some days will go wrong, perkiness be damned. But after my dad had a very serious health scare last year, I realized that every day is not promised and I can control how I approach each morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Viewing exercise as a choice, not a chore</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1402" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="856" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender.jpg 749w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender-242x300.jpg 242w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></a></p>

<p>How many times have you caught yourself saying, “I have to work out” when talking about exercise? Do you <i>have </i>to? Will you be penalized if you don’t? It seems silly to say “I get to work out,” but after I fractured my ankle two summers ago and was casted for three months, I realized what a privilege it is to have a fully functioning body.</p>
<p>Up until then, I had mostly viewed exercise at the very least, as a chore, and at the worst — as a punishment. Whether it was because I had only clocked in a couple sessions that week or had eaten something unhealthy, exercise was my recompense. If you know me, this may come as a surprise since I’m an avid exerciser. What a way to live, huh?! It’s like finding out an artist feels forced to pick up a paintbrush.</p>
<p>Being injured helped me realize that exercise is a choice and it’s my responsibility to view this positive choice in the positive light that it deserves — as a way to take care of myself, as an appreciation of my miraculous working body, and as a pathway to endorphins. It’s helped me become more committed to my workouts, even on days when they may not conveniently fit into my schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Establishing social media boundaries</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1404" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-1024x806.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="535" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-1024x806.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-300x236.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_IFNJIWURN0-768x605.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>Social media is a tool that connects people all over the world. It helps businesses thrive, is a platform for people to make money, and provides inspiration in every category from interior design to the culinary arts.</p>
<p>But as everyone knows, there’s also a dark side to social media — comparison, online bullying, jealousy, and loss of productivity are just a few black holes of social media.</p>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit that I have found myself trapped in several of these black holes, whether it’s an absent-minded time suck or comparing my body to a model’s photoshopped perfection. In order to combat these pitfalls, I started to establish social media boundaries.</p>
<p>First, I unfollowed most bloggers, celebrities, and other people whose job it is to make their social media an effervescent highlight reel. The lives portrayed on social media by many who are getting paid to be influencers don’t depict all the realities of human life, and while there’s nothing wrong with this, it’s best for me to not subject myself to media masquerades on a daily basis. Second, I implemented “designated Instagram time” throughout my day. I try to stick to only checking my social media platforms at work in the morning, during my lunch break, and when I get home from work. It helps me be more in the moment, to not get distracted from work, and to still keep up with my Instagram fam in a way that feels healthy. Lastly, I periodically go on “fasts.” While the nature of my job makes it impossible to stay off of social media completely, I will spend a few weeks occasionally foregoing my personal accounts so that I can stay off the grid for awhile and just be me, without the hashtags.</p>
<p>What works for me may not be what works for you. Maybe you eat, live, sleep, and breathe social media without a problem or maybe you could care less about posting. The undeniable fact is that we live in a digital age inundated by Tweets, status updates, and photo sharing. I want to carve out my corner of the digital space, while also keeping my feet on solid (real world) ground, and this is how I accomplish that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Swapping the T.V. remote for a book</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1405" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-300x169.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StockSnap_GXMQHDSRCV-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p>Growing up, I was the child under the covers with a flashlight reading into the night well past my bedtime. As a teenager, I never much minded summer reading for school and going to the library felt a little like Disney World. And then dial-up internet went obsolete and wifi happened. And then Netflix happened. And then Hulu happened. And then On Demand happened. And you know what? It became a lot less effort to watch anything I wanted at the tips of my fingers than to delve into a book.</p>
<p>Even though I once considered myself a bookworm, I had turned into a couch potato. It’s not to say that I didn’t read, because I did. But the amount of hours I spent bingeing a new series far outnumbered the amount of pages I was consuming — and it bothered me.</p>
<p>I told myself that I would read at least one book per month. Reading during my lunch hour and at least an hour before bed each night has helped me surpass this quota, and has also rekindled my love for the world that the written word opens up.</p>
<p>“The book is always better” because your imagination fills in all the holes a movie or T.V. show typically would for you. My imagination is my happy place and it’s fun to be a resident of it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Meal prepping every Sunday</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1406" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="767" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2.jpg 742w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FullSizeRender2-266x300.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>

<p>If you ask me on a Sunday if I like meal prepping, the answer is, “Not really.” If you ask me Monday-Saturday if I like meal prepping, the answer is a resounding, “YAS!”</p>
<p>Meal prepping requires just that — preparation. Researching recipes, making a list of ingredients, and grocery shopping all have to happen before you even make the meal. All these things considered, meal prep takes up a valuable 4-5 hours of my weekend. But, I’m personally willing to sacrifice my Sunday evenings for a list of benefits that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spending quality time with my husband</li>
<li>Doing something that doesn’t involve a screen</li>
<li>Having healthy meals throughout the week</li>
<li>Saving money by not going out to eat for lunch during the work week</li>
<li>Not having to worry about “what’s for dinner” after a long day’s work</li>
</ul>
<p>Meal prepping essentially gives me time back during the work week when I need it most and clears my schedule for other things like workouts, down time, or time with friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Saying “yes” when it counts, and “no” when it matters</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1407" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png" alt="" width="651" height="972" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png 545w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></a></p>
<p>I think the most valuable things you can give someone are your time and your word. If somebody asks for a favor, I rarely say no. While an admirable trait, it’s something that has caused me to feel overwhelmed on many occasions. I don’t like disappointing people and I tend to put a lot on my plate even when I know I should be delegating responsibilities. Additionally, as an introvert, I also feel a lot of pressure to speak up in meetings, go to happy hour after work when I’d rather go home, or fear I’m “wasting” my Saturday night in PJs when I should be out having fun.</p>
<p>I’ve been learning to say “yes” when it counts and “no” when it matters.</p>
<p>What I mean by this is, you should agree to things if:</p>
<ol>
<li>Another person could benefit, without doing physical/emotional/mental harm to yourself</li>
<li>You benefit from it — whether personally, professionally, spiritually, intellectually, mentally, etc.</li>
<li>It will cause you to grow in some way</li>
<li>It makes you feel good</li>
</ol>
<p>You should reject things that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make you feel used, unappreciated, or highly uncomfortable</li>
<li>Cause you to feel emotional, physical, or mental distress</li>
<li>Hinder you or stall your growth</li>
<li>You don’t want to do (within reason)</li>
</ol>
<p>Skipping out on a social event for some alone time is okay. Skipping out on a phone conversation with your brother because you’d rather catch up on Game of Thrones, is not. Speaking up in a meeting, while uncomfortable, is something that you should practice — especially if you have something to contribute. Saying “no” to a toxic friendship doesn’t make you a bad person, and saying “yes” to everything doesn’t necessarily make you a good one.</p>
<p>These six simple changes don’t require a drastic amount of time, money, or effort, but rather decisiveness, discipline, and practice. Feel free to share in the comments changes that you’ve made in your life that have transformed you for the better.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half the country is reveling in “sweater weather” right now, while the other half is still sporting sandals and cut-offs. If you fall into the latter group like me (no pun intended), it can be hard to feel festive for the season as pumpkin spice lattes and cozy blankets are a ways off.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re already donning those Nordstrom Anniversary Sale booties and enjoying the changing leaves or if you’re still eagerly anticipating your first brisk autumn morning, here are five ways to get into the spirit of the fall.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to The Civil Wars</span></h2>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this duo (tragically) parted ways in 2014, their music will forever live on. It’s moody AF and their beautiful blend transports you straight into a wooded, sleepy hollow type of dreamland that’s laced with longing and emotion. Or, at least that’s what it does for me. All of their music is available on Spotify.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat the </span><a href="https://www.krispykreme.com/menu/Doughnuts/PumpkinSpiceDoughnut"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin Spice Cake Donut</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Krispy Kreme</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1312" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="856" height="857" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut.png 856w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-150x150.png 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-300x300.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-768x769.png 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-80x80.png 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pumpking-spice-donut-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, don’t even argue with me about Dunkin versus Krispy because I WILL CUT YOU. (Just kidding.) But, I will use my knife to cut half of one of these babies and pretend like I’m not going to eat the whole thing and his 11 brothers and sisters in the box. Pumpkin is quintessentially fall (and in this case, only here for a limited time) and there’s nothing basic about loving a good thing.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read The Opposite of Loneliness</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1313" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="742" height="742" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book.png 742w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-150x150.png 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-300x300.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-80x80.png 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/picture-of-loneliness-book-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, summers are usually busy with vacations and trashy beach reads. As the sun starts setting earlier and I begin close out the year, I always like to read more thought-provoking material. </span></i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Opposite-Loneliness-Essays-Stories/dp/147675361X"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provokes insight from the work itself, but also because of the person who authored it. Marina Keegan, the young writer of this anthology, had just graduated Yale and landed a job at The New Yorker when she tragically died in a car accident five days after her graduation. These are the pages she left behind. And they’re good. Really damn good. </span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch Gilmore Girls (again) </span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1314" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="969" height="656" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls.png 969w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls-300x203.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gilmore-girls-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re out on your own, feeling lonely, and so cold… All you have to do is call my name and I’ll be there, on the next train! Where you lead! I will follow! A-a-a-anywhere, that you tell me to!” *Cue fall foliage shot.* Start at the beginning, from Season 1, Episode 1, because it’s fall and Rory has a crush on a boy that we later discover is Dean (#teamJess over here btw) and her mother Lorelai is all like, “Does he have a motorcycle?” and thus begins the saga of the Gilmore Girls.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a Scenic Drive</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1315" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive.png" alt="topaz and sapphire fall bucket list" width="975" height="650" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive.png 975w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive-300x200.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fall-scenic-drive-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the leaves have changed or not, whether you live in a city or in the sticks, there’s nothing like rolling the windows down a bit and just going for a drive. No destination, no time commitment, just going. Some of the best conversations and best karaoke sessions happen on the wide open road. (Trust me, experience talking over here. There’s nothing like the safe confines of a vehicle to give you the confidence to go for that Mariah Carey high note.) So grab your keys and a friend and hit the road Jack(ie) —  and make sure you come back, with somemore, somemore, somemore, somemore — of those pumpkin spice donuts. </span></i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s here! The Christmas season has officially begun and we couldn&#8217;t be more excited. With Christmas comes brighter spirits, kinder people, and lots and lots of shopping. For some gift giving is fun and enjoyable, for others holiday shopping is a thing they dread early on in the year. Regardless if you love or hate gift giving, it&#8217;s gotta be done, which is why we are here to help!</p>
<p>For <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/category/career/">#womenwhowork</a> it&#8217;s always a bit tough figuring out what to gift to your boss. You want to show that you appreciate them, but you do not want to break the bank at the same time. Considering you have more than just one person to shop for during the holiday season, the more ways you can save, the better! We scoured the web and curated the best #girlboss gifts any woman would love. The best part? The majority of &#8220;gifts &amp; things&#8221; for your boss are under $35!</p>

<p>On another note, we just wanted to thank all of you for following along our blog. 2016 has been quite the rollercoaster year for the both of us and we unfortunately had to take a six month break from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/topazandsapphire/">Topaz &amp; Sapphire</a>.</p>
<p>Now that life has settled down a little bit for the <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/about/">both of us</a>, we&#8217;re excited to connect with more of our readers and followers.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>2015 was one for the books, but Topaz &#38; Sapphire are ready for a fresh slate and to kick off the new year with a new motto to live by.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t believe 2015 is nearly over. While it has been a rewarding year for me personally and a rewarding year for Topaz &amp; Sapphire (can you believe we only <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/welcome/">launched</a> just this year?!), there is something refreshing about starting a new year with a clean slate.</p>
<p>As an ambitious woman, I am all about setting long-term and short-term goals, however, I&#8217;ve found that living by a new theme each year really helps me become the person I am striving to be.</p>
<p>This past year, I decided to live by a two-word theme: <strong>ADVENTURE</strong> and <strong>EMBRACE</strong>. 2015 was full of adventure as I traveled to nearly 15 new cities (<a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/things-to-do-in-kauai-hi/">Kauai</a> being my favorite and <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/amsterdam-things-to-do/">Amsterdam</a> coming in as a close second). I also <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/newbie-half-marathon-training-tips/">trained</a> and <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/nantucket-half-marathon/">ran my very first half marathon</a>.</p>
<p>2015 was also full of a lot of change as I started a new job and <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/moving/">moved cross-country</a> to the City of Oaks. I strived to take on change and embrace it with an optimistic attitude.</p>
<p>2015 was one for the books, but both Sapphire and I are ready for a fresh start and a new theme to live by: <strong>GIVE</strong> (for me) and <strong>ACCEPTANCE</strong> (for her).</p>
<h2>Why Choose A Motto To Live By?</h2>
<p>While it is important to set goals, setting a theme or motto to live by in the new year will help shape you as a person while also helping you meet your smaller and bigger milestones. Instead of beating yourself up about skipping a day at the gym or indulging in that Krispy Kreme donut, try thinking of the big picture and your theme for your year.</p>
<p>Statistically, 92 percent of people did not keep their New Year&#8217;s resolutions last year. For me, it&#8217;s much more gratifying and attainable to live by a motto that continuously inspires my everyday actions rather than becoming discouraged when it&#8217;s June and I haven&#8217;t even made a dent in the list of resolutions I put on paper in January.</p>
<p>Choosing your own motto to live by for a year also helps you focus on yourself, and not other people. It is often easy to compare your worst self to other people&#8217;s best selves, especially <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/the-battle-of-social-media/">via social media</a>. This year try to focus on you and your own goals. Be inspired by others, but don&#8217;t feel like you need to compete with them. Compete against yourself- you are your biggest advocate and your strongest competitor.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tis the season to deck those halls, wrap those gifts, and sip marshmallow laden hot chocolate. Though presents are not the true reason for the season, we admit that they are fun to give and receive! If you&#8217;re still stumped on what to get your bestie, mom, sister, or co-worker we&#8217;ve curated a list of 10 items that are $30 or under at our favorite store- Anthropologie.</p>
<p>Happy shopping, but most of all- have a happy time spent with loved ones!</p>
<h2>1. For the #girlboss</h2>
<p>This &#8220;<a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/home-office/36021012.jsp#/" target="_blank">Rosy Outlook 2016 Planner</a>&#8221; ($22) is fun, unconventional, inspirational, functional, and colorful. Everyone uses their phones nowadays but if you&#8217;re like us, tangible/visible organization is unmatched in old school pen and paper.</p>
<div id="attachment_762" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rosyoutlookplanner3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-762" class="size-large wp-image-762" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rosyoutlookplanner3-1024x576.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of anthropologie.com" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rosyoutlookplanner3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rosyoutlookplanner3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rosyoutlookplanner3.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-762" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of anthropologie.com</em></p></div>
<h2>2. For Anyone</h2>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t like to have their initial on &#8230; everything? Maybe it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re from the monogrammed obsessed south, but receiving a gift with your initial on it feels personal and well thought of. This $10 chic, gold, <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/29322906.jsp#/" target="_blank">limited edition mug </a>only comes out during the holiday season. (It can also be purchased in a black monogram, in stores year round.)</p>
<div id="attachment_758" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/limitededitiongoldenmonogrammug.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-758" class="size-large wp-image-758" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/limitededitiongoldenmonogrammug-683x1024.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of anthropologie.com" width="680" height="1020" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/limitededitiongoldenmonogrammug-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/limitededitiongoldenmonogrammug-200x300.jpg 200w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/limitededitiongoldenmonogrammug.jpg 1450w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-758" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of anthropologie.com</em></p></div>
<h2>3. For the Artsy girl</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/36129641.jsp#/" target="_blank">This</a> particular item is on my own wish list this year. Adult coloring books are all the rage right now and have even proved effective in calming and stress relief. With so much technology bombarding us on the daily, it&#8217;s nostalgic and fun to get back to an activity we once enjoyed as children. ($15.95)</p>

Who doesn&#8217;t love New York, if not for the big lights and Central Park, than for the food? We might snag this one for our next trip to the Concrete Jungle.</p>

<h2>7. For the baker</h2>
<p>Once upon a time Topaz was in college in her first apartment and I knew she needed some kitchen essentials. We love to bake, so I knew she would use these <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/20101796.jsp#/" target="_blank">measuring cups</a> ($24) frequently. We are always looking for kitchen essentials that are pretty enough to be on display so that we can save room in our limited cupboard spaces .</p>
<div id="attachment_760" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/milkbottlemeasuringcups.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-760" class="size-large wp-image-760" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/milkbottlemeasuringcups-683x1024.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of anthropologie.com" width="680" height="1020" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/milkbottlemeasuringcups-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/milkbottlemeasuringcups-200x300.jpg 200w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/milkbottlemeasuringcups.jpg 1450w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-760" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of anthropologie.com</em></p></div>
<h2>8. For the floral lover</h2>
<p>This <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/30571749.jsp?color=040#/" target="_blank">Jardin Des Plantes vase</a> ($28) occupies prime real estate on my bedroom dresser. It&#8217;s a decent size and holds medium sized bouquets well. Even without flowers inside, the vase speaks for itself with its misshapen and imperfect personality.</p>
<div id="attachment_757" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JardinDesPlantesVase.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-757" class="size-large wp-image-757" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JardinDesPlantesVase-683x1024.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of anthropologie.com" width="680" height="1020" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JardinDesPlantesVase-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JardinDesPlantesVase-200x300.jpg 200w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JardinDesPlantesVase.jpg 1450w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-757" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of anthropologie.com</em></p></div>
<h2>9. For the hostess with the mostess</h2>
<p>This besart <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/32997926.jsp#/" target="_blank">serving set</a> ($24) is a great gift for your holiday hostess, even if it&#8217;s your own mother. Whether you&#8217;re staying for the evening Christmas party or staying the weekend with your family, there&#8217;s bound to be food.

<h2>10. For the wanderluster</h2>
<p>This desk <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/35919182.jsp#/" target="_blank">calendar</a> ($18) is for the person in your life who never seems to be in one place for too long. Not only are the illustrations great for tearing out and framing once the year is over, but the wanderluster who receives it may even mark a new trip on their calendar.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>From Cassie:</b></h3>
<p>My momma is one of the strongest people I know. She has endured so much in her lifetime but has always remained loyal, true and loving to me and my siblings. I admire her selflessness, her desire to serve and teach, and her ability to love wholeheartedly. All of what I’ve been able to accomplish has been attributed to her. My mom is the one who has encouraged me to become who I am today. She’s been my #1 fan from day one.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FullSizeRender.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-102 aligncenter" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FullSizeRender-1024x857.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender" width="504" height="421" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FullSizeRender-1024x857.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FullSizeRender-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></a></p>
<p>As I grow older I am able to better understand how much work really goes into motherhood. I am also just in awe that my mom was able to mother and nurture not only one, but four children. She’s pushed me to reach my biggest potential. At certain times in my life she’s believed in me more than I’ve believed in myself. And for that, I will forever be grateful.</p>
<p>When I think of my favorite childhood memories involving my mom I don’t think of just one instance or one particular event. I remember the everyday things involving her; talking to her for a half hour after high school every single day out on the porch when I came home, happily accompanying her to the grocery store (especially during prime sample times at Harris Teeter), or her being literally the loudest mom cheering me on when I ran track in middle school. I’m so fortunate to have a mom that has always been involved in the everyday things, big and small.</p>
<p>I love you mom. Thanks for being the best out there! Happy Mother’s Day! XOXO</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>From Latisha:</b></h3>
<p>I’m the first born. This means I had time alone with my mom before any of my siblings came along; I’m the one who made her a mother. This makes me feel incredibly special because motherhood is not only the best role she’s ever played in life, but it’s also the one she is greatest at.</p>
<p>My mom had me 20 days before her 20th birthday. Though always wise beyond her years, she had barely entered into adulthood before the completely unexpected pregnancy re-charted the course of her life. It forced her to mature more quickly than she already had been. It required sacrifice and selflessness and a lot of faith, all of which she has continuously exhibited for the past two and a half decades I have been blessed to call her mom.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/memom.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-100  aligncenter" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/memom.jpg" alt="memom" width="571" height="420" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/memom.jpg 640w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/memom-300x221.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /></a></p>
<p>Sometimes I feel guilty, because she has given so much of herself to me and my siblings that she’s almost forgotten how to put herself first. Now an empty-nester, she’s relearning how to do this and I want to be her biggest advocate in doing so because she was always mine.</p>
<p>Motherhood is more than just “having a baby.” It’s bringing life into this world. It’s being legally responsible for that human being for the first 18 years of its life and emotionally cognizant of him/her for the rest of forever.</p>
<p>My mom is my home.</p>
<p>Happy Mother’s Day to all the women who are raising or have raised the souls entrusted to you.</p>
