					<description><![CDATA[It takes courage to take a leap like that, and that is not quitting.

I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find or make a great opportunity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I needed this :) I have been debating going back to work as a teacher--- which I ultimately love... but I don&#039;t love the idea of leaving my kids at home to raise other people&#039;s kids (which is what happens) and we are in a position that we can make it with me working for a minimal sum. I have been considering making a push with my blog to be a money maker because I love blogging and writing but have been fearful. This is exactly what I needed :)]]></description>
