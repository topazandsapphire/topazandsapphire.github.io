					<description><![CDATA[Great advice! As a workforce development specialist, I constantly try to tell our clients to truly research the company they want to work for and find out not only what the potential job duties would be but the type of environment they will be working in. It&#039;s so important to have a good understanding of this in knowing how you will fit in with the company&#039;s mission and goals. Awesome post! :)]]></description>
