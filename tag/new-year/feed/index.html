								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each new year offers the opportunity to become a better you &#8211; to reset and reevaluate goals. As we begin 2019, I&#8217;ve decided to share my 2019 mantras with all of you. By sharing my goals I hope to inspire you to set some of your own, so we can work together to be the women we&#8217;re proudest to be.</p>
<p>As in years past, I have chosen to stick to two <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/a-new-year-a-new-motto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">words to live by</a>: &#8220;consistency&#8221; and &#8220;unstoppable.&#8221; These words will dictate the overarching theme of my specific goals this year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1500" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-1-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Through <strong>consistency </strong>I hope to build better and sustainable habits, while <strong>unstoppable </strong>encompasses all the bucket list items I wish to cross off this year. My only rule for creating my bucket list is that it can&#8217;t include anything I&#8217;ve already planned or booked already. (For example, if you signed up to run a half marathon in 2018 that takes place in 2019, you shouldn&#8217;t write &#8220;run a half marathon&#8221; on your list.)</p>
<p>Below are few examples of sub-goals and bucket list items I have made under each mantra. For me, making goals specific helps me to better follow through.</p>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Less sugar. Think of desserts as a treat or something special, versus an everyday snack I&#8217;m entitled to</li>
<li>Build a better nightly routine</li>
<li>Less mobile media consumption &#8211; i.e. 40 minutes of Instagram per day</li>
<li>Journal more (at least 2x per month)</li>
<li>Go to bed each night with a clean kitchen</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unstoppable</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visit 12 new cities or unfamiliar places</li>
<li>Read 20 books</li>
<li>Visit 1 new country</li>
<li>Complete 1 photo project</li>
<li>Join some sort of hobby-related club</li>
<li>Send 2 snail mail letters per month</li>
</ul>
<p>While this isn&#8217;t an all encompassing list, hopefully some of these things can help you spark ideas for goals or bucket list items  your own. It&#8217;s understood that not all individuals are the same and do not set or establish goals the same way. For me, writing down a list of things holds me accountable. Rather than living by a mantra, you may prefer creating a bucket list or creating monthly goals vs. yearly goals.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1502" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg" alt="2019 Mantra | Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Attachment-3-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>However setting goals looks for you &#8211; embrace it! There is no right or wrong way to set goals. My only tip for setting New Year&#8217;s resolutions is to tell at least one other person your goals, whether that&#8217;s your mom, roomie, significant other, dog, etc. Telling someone else helps you feel more committed to your goals and gives you a greater sense of accountability in order to accomplish them. And remember, it&#8217;s never too late to set goals!</p>
<h2>The Importance of Setting Goals</h2>
<p>Setting goals has always been so important to me. With an <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achiever personality</a>, a lot of my self-satisfaction comes from achieving something, even if it&#8217;s small. Even without this type of personality, I find almost <em>all</em> people, whether they know it or not, feel their best when they have accomplished something they have worked toward. Whether that&#8217;s sleep training your baby, getting that promotion at work, or learning to bake a fluffy chocolate chip cookie &#8211; anytime you&#8217;re accomplishing something as an individual are moments you can look back on with fondness. Some of our proudest moments in life are when we&#8217;ve successfully completed something we&#8217;ve set our minds to accomplish or improve in ourselves, which is why it&#8217;s so important to set goals &#8211; big and small!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>2015 was one for the books, but Topaz &#38; Sapphire are ready for a fresh slate and to kick off the new year with a new motto to live by.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t believe 2015 is nearly over. While it has been a rewarding year for me personally and a rewarding year for Topaz &amp; Sapphire (can you believe we only <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/welcome/">launched</a> just this year?!), there is something refreshing about starting a new year with a clean slate.</p>
<p>As an ambitious woman, I am all about setting long-term and short-term goals, however, I&#8217;ve found that living by a new theme each year really helps me become the person I am striving to be.</p>
<p>This past year, I decided to live by a two-word theme: <strong>ADVENTURE</strong> and <strong>EMBRACE</strong>. 2015 was full of adventure as I traveled to nearly 15 new cities (<a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/things-to-do-in-kauai-hi/">Kauai</a> being my favorite and <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/amsterdam-things-to-do/">Amsterdam</a> coming in as a close second). I also <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/newbie-half-marathon-training-tips/">trained</a> and <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/nantucket-half-marathon/">ran my very first half marathon</a>.</p>
<p>2015 was also full of a lot of change as I started a new job and <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/moving/">moved cross-country</a> to the City of Oaks. I strived to take on change and embrace it with an optimistic attitude.</p>
<p>2015 was one for the books, but both Sapphire and I are ready for a fresh start and a new theme to live by: <strong>GIVE</strong> (for me) and <strong>ACCEPTANCE</strong> (for her).</p>
<h2>Why Choose A Motto To Live By?</h2>
<p>While it is important to set goals, setting a theme or motto to live by in the new year will help shape you as a person while also helping you meet your smaller and bigger milestones. Instead of beating yourself up about skipping a day at the gym or indulging in that Krispy Kreme donut, try thinking of the big picture and your theme for your year.</p>
<p>Statistically, 92 percent of people did not keep their New Year&#8217;s resolutions last year. For me, it&#8217;s much more gratifying and attainable to live by a motto that continuously inspires my everyday actions rather than becoming discouraged when it&#8217;s June and I haven&#8217;t even made a dent in the list of resolutions I put on paper in January.</p>
<p>Choosing your own motto to live by for a year also helps you focus on yourself, and not other people. It is often easy to compare your worst self to other people&#8217;s best selves, especially <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/the-battle-of-social-media/">via social media</a>. This year try to focus on you and your own goals. Be inspired by others, but don&#8217;t feel like you need to compete with them. Compete against yourself- you are your biggest advocate and your strongest competitor.</p>
