She&#8217;s the water to my fire, my biggest listening ear, my personal eyebrow plucker, my saving grace when I don&#8217;t know what top to purchase at TJ Maxx (because I obviously can&#8217;t get all five of them).</p>

<p>You were born into this world under tougher circumstances than most, but it&#8217;s made you a fighter and that&#8217;s what I love about you most: your endurance to push through, no matter what the challenge. You are the best biggest sister, (obviously) mom&#8217;s favorite child, and a thoughtful friend.</p>
<p><strong>Cheers to you cheetah sister! Happy 26th birthday! XOXO</strong></p>
<p>To commemorate her birthday, I interviewed Latisha and asked her some reflective questions about life and celebrating another year. Click play below. If you don&#8217;t want to listen to the entire thing, I&#8217;ve included what time cues to play each question below.</p>
<p>0:33 What has been your biggest accomplishment so far?</p>
<p>1:10 If you could go back 10 years, what advice would you give yourself?</p>
<p>1:55 How would you compare your childhood dreams to where you are in life now?</p>
<p>2:20 What&#8217;s going to be your next home purchase?</p>
<p>2:40 What are you most looking forward to in your 27th year?</p>
<p>3:10 What&#8217;s your biggest pet peeve and has that changed?</p>
<p>3:35 Will you continue sleeping with your blankies this year?</p>
<p>4:25 Would you rather get arrested and spend a night in jail or give birth to a baby tonight (sans 9 months of pregnancy)?</p>
<p>4:50 If money wasn&#8217;t a factor, how would you celebrate your 26th birthday?</p>
<p>5:11 BLOOPERS (if anything watch these&#8230;they&#8217;re hilarious if I do say so myself hahaha)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Follow us on Instagram, <a href="http://instagram.com/topazandsapphire">@topazandsapphire</a> to see what we&#8217;ll be up to tomorrow evening whilst celebrating Sapphire&#8217;s birthday!</p>

Brady and I both agree that we treat, spoil, and maul our puppy child like she is a human child, but we don&#8217;t even care. God bless our future human children&#8217;s cheeks and bums that they won&#8217;t get pinched off by the time they turn one.</p>
<p>Charlotte Barkley, thanks for adding so much spunk, pep, and happiness into our lives. You&#8217;ll always be our first born, our #1 girl! We love you punkin!</p>
<p>Now onto the puppy pawty we threw this spoiled nugget&#8230;</p>

<p>I was basically forced to make these birthday hats for Charlotte&#8217;s birthday party (but I&#8217;m not complaining because they turned out phenom!). When I went to Michael&#8217;s to get the supplies for this birthday garland (<a href="http://www.thesweetestoccasion.com/2012/04/diy-pompom-garland/">directions found here</a>), I assumed they would have birthday hats to purchase. When I asked the girl at Michael&#8217;s where the birthday hats were in the store she looked at me stunned and said, &#8220;We have stuff to make party hats, but we don&#8217;t have them already made in a package.&#8221; I pretty much disgusted her by my lack of creativity. For convenience of not having to go to another store, I bought fun paper and used the left over yarn from the garland and voila these presh homemade birthday hats were born. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll forever make them now because the prints are way cuter than any pre-made birthday hats, #amirite!? Thanks Michael&#8217;s employee for making me make these things from scratch.</p>

<p>Recipe for the dog friendly cake can be found <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/doggie-birthday-cake/?mxt=t06dda">here</a>. Charlotte absolutely loved her cake. I would suggest halving the recipe though. This thing came out bigger than expected and Charlotte was only able to eat 1/8 of it.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t already know, I am my mother&#8217;s daughter. When I throw a party, I throw a party (even if it&#8217;s just for your puppy&#8217;s first birthday). So yes, of course I went all out with home made doggie cake, cheesecake, and decor&#8230;because #YOLO and #ILikeToParty. Comment below if you want the cheesecake recipe, it&#8217;s a family recipe that&#8217;s to die for.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>From Cassie:</b></h3>
<p>My momma is one of the strongest people I know. She has endured so much in her lifetime but has always remained loyal, true and loving to me and my siblings. I admire her selflessness, her desire to serve and teach, and her ability to love wholeheartedly. All of what I’ve been able to accomplish has been attributed to her. My mom is the one who has encouraged me to become who I am today. She’s been my #1 fan from day one.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FullSizeRender.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-102 aligncenter" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FullSizeRender-1024x857.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender" width="504" height="421" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FullSizeRender-1024x857.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FullSizeRender-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></a></p>
<p>As I grow older I am able to better understand how much work really goes into motherhood. I am also just in awe that my mom was able to mother and nurture not only one, but four children. She’s pushed me to reach my biggest potential. At certain times in my life she’s believed in me more than I’ve believed in myself. And for that, I will forever be grateful.</p>
<p>When I think of my favorite childhood memories involving my mom I don’t think of just one instance or one particular event. I remember the everyday things involving her; talking to her for a half hour after high school every single day out on the porch when I came home, happily accompanying her to the grocery store (especially during prime sample times at Harris Teeter), or her being literally the loudest mom cheering me on when I ran track in middle school. I’m so fortunate to have a mom that has always been involved in the everyday things, big and small.</p>
<p>I love you mom. Thanks for being the best out there! Happy Mother’s Day! XOXO</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>From Latisha:</b></h3>
<p>I’m the first born. This means I had time alone with my mom before any of my siblings came along; I’m the one who made her a mother. This makes me feel incredibly special because motherhood is not only the best role she’s ever played in life, but it’s also the one she is greatest at.</p>
<p>My mom had me 20 days before her 20th birthday. Though always wise beyond her years, she had barely entered into adulthood before the completely unexpected pregnancy re-charted the course of her life. It forced her to mature more quickly than she already had been. It required sacrifice and selflessness and a lot of faith, all of which she has continuously exhibited for the past two and a half decades I have been blessed to call her mom.</p>
