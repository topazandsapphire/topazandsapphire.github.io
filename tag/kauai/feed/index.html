								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While visiting Kauai, Brady and I were able to eat out at some fabulous places. From brunch and desserts, to fancy dinners and hole in the wall restaurants, here is a list of all of our favorite places to eat on the island! Enjoy!</p>
<p>Fun fact: Ono in Hawaiian means &#8220;delicious&#8221; which is why half the names of these places have Ono in the name.</p>
<h3>1. Kalaheo Coffee Co. &amp; Cafe</h3>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2404.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-162" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2404-768x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_2404" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2404-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2404-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<h5>His: The North Shore Breakfast | Hers: The Kahili Breakfast</h5>
<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with brunch, so of course we Brady and I were on the hunt to find the best brunch place on the island. The savory Kahili breakfast that I ordered was not only scrumptious, but it kept me full for a really long time, which allowed us to pack in more activities this day. You know a restaurant is good when you see locals coming and going. I&#8217;m not a coffee drinker, but if you are this place is known for their coffee! So make sure to try some of that too when you go.</p>
<h3>2. Koloa Mills Ice Cream</h3>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2369.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-161" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2369-768x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_2369" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2369-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2369-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<h5>His: Chocolate Macademia Nut | Hers: Mango Cream</h5>
<p>This place was scrumptious. We loved it so much we came here at least three times during our 5.5 days on the island. My favorite food is ice cream, and if I could I would eat their mango cream ice cream for breakfast. It was so refreshing and creamy. Honestly, you can&#8217;t go wrong with any of the flavors here.</p>
<h3>3. Ono Restaurant</h3>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2503.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-164" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2503-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_2503" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2503-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2503-300x225.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2503-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<h5>His: Coconut Banana Pancakes | Hers: Spinach Artichoke Omelette</h5>
<p>I thought the spinach artichoke omelette was good&#8230;until I tried Brady&#8217;s coconut banana pancakes. Oh my gosh, they are TO DIE FOR. Sometimes bananas make my stomach upset, but in this instance I didn&#8217;t even care how my body would react later, these pancakes were too good to pass up. They cook bananas inside the pancake batter, top it off with more bananas, fresh coconut, and the most amazing homemade coconut syrup. I don&#8217;t care if you hate bananas or coconut or both, you NEED to try these flapjacks!</p>
<h3>4. Koloa Shaved Ice</h3>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2448.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-163" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2448-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_2448" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2448-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2448-300x225.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2448-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<h5>Shared: Pina Colada Shaved Ice</h5>
<p>Refreshing and sweet, this frozen treat satisfies anytime of the day. There are a few other shaved ice places scattered throughout Kauai, but this one was my favorite. It&#8217;s a little bit pricier, but they have the best flavors and they don&#8217;t charge you more for the add-ons like ice cream or sweetened condensed milk.</p>
<h3>5. Pizzetta</h3>
<h5>His: Seafood Fettucini | Hers: Cheese Pizza</h5>
<p>My friend recommended that we go eat here, and I&#8217;m so glad we did. The service was phenomenal, the food was delish, and the ambience was casual yet warm. Most places in Kauai close around 8 or 9 pm, so it was nice that Pizzetta was open significantly later. This place was good, but not anything off the charts or authentic to Kauai.</p>
<h3>6. Ono Char-Burger</h3>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2670.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-165" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2670-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_2670" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2670-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2670-300x225.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2670-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<h5>His: Teriyaki Burger | Hers: Ono Cheeseburger</h5>
<p>Be prepared for a long wait if you decide to come to this hole in the wall. In my opinion, the wait was totally worth it. We had to wait 40 minutes after we ordered to receive our burgers. The girl working told us before we ordered that it would be that long, but we decided to wait it out and order anyways. I&#8217;m glad we did &#8211; my cheeseburger was fabulous. Not to mention, the prices are fair ($4-$6 for a burger). Brady wasn&#8217;t head over heels for his teriyaki burger, but I honestly just think he was a little too hangry to have an honest opinion. I did order their papaya frozen drink, and it wasn&#8217;t that good &#8211; stick with the burgers.</p>
<h3>7. Pink&#8217;s Creamery</h3>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2758.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-166" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2758-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_2758" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2758-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2758-300x225.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2758-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<h5>His: Hawaiian Grilled Cheese | Hers: Hanalei Sunset</h5>
<p>Located on the North Shore, this ice cream parlor is a very strong contender to Koloa Mills Ice Cream. I still can&#8217;t decide which place was better. We went in for ice cream, but ended up ordering a Hawaiian Grilled Cheese too. The sandwich was amazing not like any other grilled cheese I&#8217;ve had before. I highly recommend stopping here on your way to or from your Kalalua hike since it&#8217;s right on the way!</p>
<h3>8. Keoki&#8217;s Paradise</h3>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2907.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-167" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2907-768x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_2907" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2907-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2907-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<h5>His: Seafood Risotto | Hers: Prime Rib</h5>
<p>We were trying to decide whether to go here for our fancy night out to eat, or to the Beach House. The Beach House is known for its on-the-beach location and the breathtaking views during sunset. We almost went there just for the location. However, when we went on our Napoli Coast boat tour, our captain told us the Beach House food was average; he suggested we go to Keoki&#8217;s Paradise if we wanted good food. We opted for the better food, and trusted the captain&#8217;s opinion. I&#8217;m so happy we did. The food was amazing. Best food we had on the island by far. In addition, the ambience was spectacular. No one ever told us what to expect as far as location, but it was beautiful! It&#8217;s not located on the beach, but the surrounding foliage, pond, and birds flying in and out of the inside-outside location made for such a fun experience. <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2897.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-174" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2897-768x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_2897" width="680" height="907" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2897-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_2897-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<h3>9. Da Crack</h3>
<h5>His: Chicken Burrito | Hers: Homemade Nachos</h5>
<p>This Mexican place hole in the wall was the biggest surprise. We were looking for something quick and cheap, but didn&#8217;t expect much from the food. Overall, the food was tasty but the most noteworthy item on their menu that had made me wanting to go back was their homemade chips.</p>
<h3>10. Mark&#8217;s Place</h3>
<h5>His: Mark&#8217;s Famous Mixed Plate | Hers: Teriyaki Plate</h5>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an authentic Hawaiian meal, this place is the bomb. If you&#8217;re a fan of L&amp;L, this place is like that but 10x better. I loved my Teriyaki Plate, but if you want a little taste of everything try Mark&#8217;s famous mixed plate. Just so you&#8217;re aware, this place doesn&#8217;t have seating so be prepared to get it to-go.</p>
<p>Notable Mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lappert&#8217;s Ice Cream</li>
<li>Merriman&#8217;s Burgers &amp; Fish</li>
<li>Passion Bakery</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sure when my obsession with Polynesian culture, luaus, and Hawaiian beaches started, but as a child I&#8217;ve always dreamed of visiting Hawaii; it was my dream! Growing up in North Carolina, traveling to Hawaii was further than traveling to Europe. When Brady and I got married two years ago, I told him we HAD to go to Hawaii at some point before we left Utah to live back east. He promised we would go, and lo and behold we found ourselves celebrating our two year wedding anniversary on the gorgeous island of Kauai.</p>
<p>We debated for a while on what island to visit, but after raving recommendations and reviews, we decided to go to Kauai for our first Hawaiian experience. I am SO HAPPY we did. There was SO much to do and see on this luscious island. It&#8217;s amazing how versatile and different each side of the island is. The beauty, the people, the food, and the places were all phenomenal. Our entire visit I just walked around with my jaw dropped open in awe that this beautiful place was actually real.</p>
<p>With so much to see and do, I&#8217;ve narrowed it down to my favorite 8 things to do. If you&#8217;re planning your vacation to Kauai anytime soon, these are my must-do recommendations!</p>

<p>The Napali Coast is magnificent, truly a jaw dropping sight to see. The only way to access the Napali Coast is by ocean or hiking. I would recommend both. Unfortunately our original boat tour of the Napali Coast got cancelled due to high tides and extreme wind conditions. Luckily for us, we were able to reschedule with a different boating company and I&#8217;m so glad we did. Although not as intimate and adventurous as we imagined, we were able to witness the majestic beauty of the coast from the ocean, including 10-15 dolphin sightings, sea turtles, a seal, and a glimpse of some sea caves. If you can book a tour with the <a href="http://napaliexperience.com/">Napoli Coast Experience</a>, they will take you inside the sea caves and snorkeling right on the coast. Make sure to book at least 2-3 weeks from your trip as spots fill up quickly and the boat only holds 6 people, plus the captain. We took the <a href="https://www.holoholokauaiboattours.com/">Holo Holo Charters</a> boat tour and had a great experience with them. I will say they boat on choppier conditions because the vessel is a lot bigger, holding nearly 40 passengers. At times the ride was pretty wild. If you&#8217;re prone to sea sickness, this boating company is not the tour for you.</p>
<h2>2. Queens Bath</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3120.jpg"><img class="" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3120.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="631" /></a><br />
<a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3121.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3121.jpg" alt="" /></a> I honestly wasn&#8217;t prepared for how interesting and beautiful Queens Bath is. Google images definitely don&#8217;t do this place justice. It&#8217;s a natural attraction for both locals and tourists alike. Located on the North Shore, Queens Bath is a unique tide pool surrounded by black igneous rock and filled with small sea creatures. For the adrenaline junkies, you can even jump from the towering igneous rock cliff into the Queens Bath.</p>
<h2>3. Secret Beach</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3123.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3123.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
<a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3124.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3124.jpg" alt="" /></a>  <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3122.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3122.jpg" alt="" /></a>  A literal hidden gem, this beautiful beach is tucked away on the North side of Kauai. It is accessed by a steep hike through vegetation off of a small dirt road. The beach is so big that you really feel like it&#8217;s empty. The ocean was a little more rough when I went, but it made for some fun boogie boarding. If you take a long walk away from the entrance of the beach, beware of hippie nudists. We saw a few bare butt cheeks and some topless girls, but it just made for an even more enriching experience&#8230;</p>
<h2>4. Kauai Bike Path</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3127.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3127.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3126.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3126.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3125.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3125.jpg" alt="" /></a>Located on the East shore, this paved path runs right along the shoreline and is an easy and enjoyable ride for people of all ages. We rented our beach cruisers from a little bike shop behind Ono&#8217;s Restaurant. For two bikes for two hours, it was only $15 total. Such a steal! At the end of the Kauai bike path, make sure to lock your bikes up and explore Donkey Beach. There are no signs indicating you can access the beach at the end of the path, but there is a dirt road you can walk on to access it. We had no idea Donkey Beach was located there until we returned our bikes.</p>
<h2>5. Kalalau Trail</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3128.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3128.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3130.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3130.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3129.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3129.jpg" alt="" /></a>This should be at the top of your list of things to do if you&#8217;re visiting the island anytime soon. This trail runs along the Napoli Coast and offers unbelievable views throughout the entire hike. The trail runs 11 miles but you can hike until your heart&#8217;s content. We hiked until we hit the beach (about 6 miles round trip), but if you hike another two miles there is this huge waterfall you can see. The trail is pretty muddy in parts so make sure you wear shoes that you can wash or throw away afterwards. Because of the somewhat rocky terrain and a few stubbed toes, I&#8217;d recommend closed toe shoes and not chacos when you do this hike.</p>
<h2>6. Poipu Beach</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3132.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3132.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3131.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3131.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3133.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3133.jpg" alt="" /></a> This is the most popular beach to go to on the South shore. The waves are great for surfing, paddle boarding, and boogie boarding. Not to mention, you&#8217;re more than likely to spot a sea turtle or two here swimming in the ocean. Although dubbed the most &#8220;touristy&#8221; side of the island, Poipu beach and the surrounding town of Koloa is filled with great eats, quaint shops, and locals alike.</p>
<h2>7. Hanalei Lookout</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3135.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3135.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3134.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3134.jpg" alt="" /></a> On your way to Hanalei, make sure to make a pitstop at the Hanalei lookout. It&#8217;s quick and painless and well worth a couple of pictures &#8211; the view of the lush valley is phenomenal.</p>
<h2>8. Shipwreck Beach &amp; Hike</h2>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3136.jpg"><img src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3136.jpg" alt="" /></a> Shipwreck is located on the South shore near Poipu beach. Although it shows no signs of a shipwreck, this beach offers few visitors (at least while we were there) and a short and easy hike! If you&#8217;re not much a hiker, but want some spectacular views of the South side shoreline, this is your type of hike. Brady and I even hiked it in our flip flops. How&#8217;s that for island life!?</p>
