					<description><![CDATA[Zachary! I love your recommendation to get outside and get active even during the workday. You&#039;re so sweet for reading our blog. Good luck with your very first full-time work week. Hopefully we can find a time to catch up soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like this! I&#039;m doing my first &quot;40-hour work week&quot; this summer and it has been challenging getting into a good routine and staying productive all day long. I really like #9. Planning out what you&#039;re going to do the night before will help you sleep better and wake up with a purpose. I&#039;ve also found that working out or walking for 30 minutes outside helps me feel more productive and happy in life and in the office.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah if I had the choice I&#039;d probably only take a 30 minute break so I could leave a little earlier every day. It&#039;s tough to decide, but it helps only living 5 min from the office.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this! I seriously need to set specific times of day to check my email. It&#039;s a black hole. And I&#039;m always so conflicted about if I should take a lunch break or not... It&#039;s so helpful to have a break but I also love leaving work earlier, haha. Too bad my job doesn&#039;t make the choice for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love all these tips! The hardest ones for me are designating times for email/social media and actually sticking to it. I also love wearing headphones because I listen to everything around me so those help a lot. Thanks for sharing!!]]></description>
