					<description><![CDATA[Amen! I think even just researching more about a topic you&#039;re passionate about is a good way to take a stand. Too many people just believe what they are told instead of finding it out for themselves. I think that would be a great start!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I too stay out of it because tone can never be fully understood through typing on social media. A john Meyer song says &quot;no one ever changed their mind from paint on a sign&quot; Actual action is the only way to make it happen so I love that you wrote &quot;get out from behind your computer&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this. I don&#039;t really share my opinion on social media when it comes to controversial or even popular topics. I don&#039;t see the need to get into a debate with someone I&#039;ve never met or where my words can be misconstrued. I love your plan about more action. I&#039;m all about that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post. I used to work for a cancer charity and slacktivism drove us mad. &quot;No I can&#039;t volunteer/donate/chat/do anything - besides I have a pink/orange/white/blue ribbon and a status notification on my social media so I&#039;m supporting you already&quot;. By all means have those things - they&#039;re great for getting the word out and making sure people are entering sensible and healthy dialogue (I know, I know - but a girl can dream) - but actually DO something if you really do want change. It doesn&#039;t have to be money - time and effort are even more helpful.]]></description>
